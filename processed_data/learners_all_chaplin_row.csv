He looks up to the window from where the trash was thrown out and picks the baby up.  <br/>  <br/> Right behind him arrives a woman with a Buggy. She seems to look for something.Chaplin tries to get her attention, while she is returning from entering a house entrance he sets the baby into the buggy to the other kid. The woman is furious and tells him after Chaplin wants to leave her with both kids in the buggy to take the kid back and he eventually does that and walks away. <br/>  <br/> Chaplin arrives at the spot where he found the baby and put it back while a policeman arrived behind him seriously scanning the Situation. Chaplin turning around and almost stumbling into the policeman returns to the baby, picks it up and walks around the corner and finds an elderly man with a walking stick. Chaplin puts the baby in his arms and fastly walks away after pretending he needs to tie up his shoe. <br/>  <br/> The elderly man quickly walks with the baby around the corner just to find a buggy with another kid inside where he places the baby and disappears. After he is gone the woman from before steps out of the entrance and looks at the buggy, gets annoyed and is likely to look for Charlie Chaplin who encounters again the police man and eventually passes without any reaction. She follows him, hits him with her umbrella and drags him back to the buggy. They argue about the baby when the policeman joints the situation. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby out of the buggy and walks away, so do the others.  <br/>  <br/> Chaplin sits on the sidewalk thinking about putting the baby into a duct but then he rolls back.  <br/> He looks at the baby and finds a note saying that this baby is an orphan and needs love and care.  <br/> He smiles at the baby in his arms, gets up and walks away with it.

A few seconds later after smoking a cigarette, he discovers a child lying on the floor. He picks it up and searches for the mother. Afterwards, a mother with a child passes by. Chaplin thinks, that she might be the mother of the child. But that is not the case, because she denies being the mother. This leads to Chaplin laying the child back down where he found it, until a police officer appears. Without wanting to leave a bad impression, he picks up the child again and runs away, until he gives it to a homeless person on the way. The homeless person lays the child in a baby buggy, which belongs to the mother from a few moments ago. Of course there is no other than Charlie Chaplin who appears afterwards, which leads to the mother beating him up. The policeman appears afterwards as well, so Chaplin has to leave again with the baby. Sitting on the street with the kid, Chaplin discovers a letter and gets to know that the child has been abandoned by its parents. Finally, one can see Chaplin smiling towards the orphan holding it.

In the first sequence one can see Charlie Chaplin lighting a cigarette. By doing so he suddenly notices a baby besides the bins on the ground. He is not able to identify the parents of the baby. As he sees a woman passing by with a stroller, he suggests that it could be the mother of the baby. So he layed the baby in to the stroller. It turned out that it was not her baby. As a consequence she started mocking at Charlie, so he had to take it out of the stroller again. As he had no other idea where to place down the baby, he layed it back to the place he found the baby. But this move failed again. A officer cought him laying down the baby on the floor so he had to pick up the baby again. Once more he is disperately thinking of an other option. He encounters an old man, which he could hand over the baby with a ruse and flees right afterwards. This olderly man then sees the woman with the stroller, and puts it in the stroller as Charlie had done before. Therfore the woman suggested Charlie the one ho had put the baby in her stroller as Charlie crossed her way. She hits him with a umbrella and gives him back the baby. Charlie gives up and now realises that it is  an orphan baby as he finds a small letter which says to please take care of that orphan baby.

Suddenly he gets hit by some of the trash a neighbour threw out and complained. As he looked down to clean himself up and light another cigar, he notices the babys cries and lift it up. In the exact moment a woman with a stroller and her own baby walks into the background of the scene, Chaplin thought that she might accidently lost her child and wanted to return it. He put the baby he just found into the stroller and implied that she dropped something, the mother reacts furious and wants him to take the baby and leave. As he walked back to the spot where he had found the baby, a police officer walked in. Chaplin notices him and picks the baby up again because he didn't want to get into trouble for abandoning the baby. He walks around the corner and notices an older man,  suddenly he had an idea how to get rid of the child for his own sake. He asked the man to hold the baby while he ties his shoe laces, he agreed and as soon as he seemed distracted Chaplin ran away. He hid in a parking lot, confused the older man searches for him and came across the stroller with a baby inside and just laid the baby he just recieved inside. As Chaplin wanted to leave the scene, the Police Officer appeared again and he knowingly avoids him. Thus he walks by the woman with the stroller, that noticed that the baby was inside her stroller again, she assumed that Chaplin had dropped it in there again and furiously attacks him with her umbrella. Angrily she drags him to the stroller and shouts at him, that he should take the baby and leave. Once again the police officer stepped into the scene and the woman seems to try to get his help but decided just to leave. Chaplin leaves the scene as well and decided to sit down on the roadside with the baby on his lap. He contemplates wherever he should get rid of the baby and looked suspiciously into the sewerage. He declined that thought and turned the baby into another position in his arms and notices a small letter in which is written that this baby is a orphan, a child without living parents and that someone should take care for the baby and treat it with love. As he realised the sad fate of this baby, he smiled at it and interacted with it quite caring and leaves the scene.

Suddenly, he was hit by a big stone from another unknown person. He stoped and pulled out a small box out of his inner jacket pocket. He opened the box, took out a new cigarette, put off his gloves, and touched his shoe sole in order to set fire to his cigarette. Not knowing where to put his gloves, he threw them in the can next to him. As the looked to the other side, he saw a baby left alone next to the ashes on the street. He went to the baby but then looked up to the windows, thinking whether someone threw the baby out or was missing it. Then he lifted the baby up and wasn‘t sure where to go. As he saw a woman with a trolley walking behind him, he followed her. She entered into the building while Charly laid the baby in her trolley. She came out and saw a second baby in her trolley, then saw Chaplin, shoutet at him and told him to take the baby. Charly went back to the spot where he found the baby and wanted to lay it there.

Suddenly someone throughs out garbage from an open window, he manages to step aside. A few steps later he is not that lucky. In anger Chaplin recognizes that is cigarette was blown out and he takes out a new one with very explicit movements which is characteristic for Charlie Chaplins slapstick scenes. Afterwards he looks around and discovers a crying baby laying between a wall and some trashcans. Meanwhile a young mother walks past in the background with a pushchair and a baby. Chaplin sees her and as she shortly walks into a house he places the baby next to the child of the unknown women. Unfortunately she walks out again just in this very moment and does not seem amused at all. So he then tries something else and carries the baby back to the place where he found it. Just as he turns around to walk away a man in uniform stands a few steps behind him giving him a strict look that makes Chaplin taking the child back on immediately. Another set appears, Chaplin walks down a street to an old man and hands him the baby, pretending to fix his shoe laces so he can run away. The old man chases him but is not able to move fast enough. He walks past the pushchair of the lady from the first scene and tries the same trick as Chaplin did before. He gets along with it but as soon as the mother walks out a magazine door and sees the second child she starts to search the street. Chaplin passes by, thinking himself safe as the mother runs after him and slaps him with her umbrella. He has to take the baby back and in the last scene he sits down on the street with the little child in his arm wondering what to do with it. Looking at its face and little clothing he discovers a piece of paper, unfolds it and after reading he know nows that this is an orphan child someone hoped that good people would care about. He smiles and then walks off into the distance, carrying his new child.

While he tries to figure out where the child’s mother might be, a woman with a baby stroller enters the stage. Assuming she is the mother, he lays the newborn into the stroller, next to the woman’s child. As she is not the mother, she indignantly urges him to pick up his child and leaves the alleyway. While Mister Chaplin is laying down the newborn next to the trashcan again, a police officer enters the alleyway – Mister Chaplin is forced to take the child again. By a trick he hands over the child to a stranger, who is laying down the child in the baby stroller of the mother, who entered the alleyway earlier. After that Mister Chaplin walks across the stroller and, again, gets forced to pick the child up by the woman and the patrolling police officer. Not knowing what to do next, he sits down on the sidewalk and finds a letter, hidden in the child’s blanket, saying he should take care of the orphan. He seems to compassionate the child, takes it in his arms, gets up and leaves the stage.

Behind a trashcan he finds a little baby wrapped in a blanket. A woman with a buggy walks by and he is thinking that she lots the baby and puts it into her buggy. Then she is in rage and tells him that this is not her baby. Charlie goes back to the place where he found the baby and lays it down, right back behind the trashcan. A police officer appears and seems to think that Charlie tries to abandon the baby. To avoid serious trouble, Charlie takes the baby with him down the street. He asks an old man with a walking stick to hold the baby for a moment and runs way. The old man can't find Charlie, but spots a buggy (the same of the woman at the beginning of the story) and lays the baby in the buggy and runs away. Charlie walks by a few seconds later and the woman comes out of a store, finding the foreign baby in her buggy again. She sees Charlie and beats him with her umbrella. Again the police officer walks by, to avoid serious trouble again, Charlie takes the baby and sits down the street on the sidewalk. He thinks about to throw the child into a sewer, but rejects that thought. He finds a letter in the blanket, which says to care for this orphaned child. He smiles at the baby and takes it with him.

While walking a man in an apartment is throwing out some building rubble, Chaplin is not getting hit by it but is cleaning his suit from the dusk. As he keeps walking there's another man who is throwing  rubbish out of the window. This time Chaplin get hit and is getting angry. To recover of the stress he's putting his cigarrettes out of a box in his pocket. Before starting to smoke he's pulling off his gloves. It seems like he lights the match on his shoe. While smoking he's looking around and recognizes a baby who is laying next to the rubbish bins. Chaplin starts looking around to find someone who might be the one responsible for the child, but can't find anyone. While he's grabbing the baby a woman with a stroller, with already one baby sitting in in, passes by. As soon as the woman stopped to go into the building Chaplin puts the baby he found in the woman's stroller. In this moment the woman is coming out of the door and starts shouting at him to make cleare, that it's not her child,. That's why Charles takes the child back into his arms again and is walking away. He wants to put the baby pack to the place where he found it but a police officer passed by at this moment, so Charles decided to walk away with the baby. On his way he comes across a older man with a walking stick, Charles is acting like tying his shoes to be able to put the baby into the arms of the old man. After a few seconds he starts running away and leaves the man alone with the baby. The old man starts running after him, but can't find Charles who is hiding behind a door. His way leads the man to the stroller of the woman earlier and like Chaplin did, he puts the baby in the stroller and runs away. As soon as Charles comes out of his hiding place he's running into the arms of the police officer again. Meanwhile the women comes out of the building and finds the baby again in her stroller. Charles walks by the stroller again and the woman recognize him and is starting to hit him with her umbrella whilst pulling him back to the stroller with the two babys. While arguing with the women the police officer passes by who became aware of the situation, the fight led to nothing and Charles grabs the baby again and walks away. He's sitting down on a kerb with the babys in his arms. Next to him is a discharge shaft and for a short moment he's thinking about putting the baby in there - but he decides otherwise. He's taking a closer look at the baby and finds a note in the cover which is saying ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". That's why he decides to take care of the lonely child and takes it with him."

When he passes the houses he is always hit by objects that somebody throws out of the window. After a while he reaches a place of dustbins where there is no risk of falling items anymore. When he calmly smokes a cigarette he notices a bundle of clothes behind one of the containers. Charlie Chaplin soon finds out that there is a baby inside the bundle. At first, he assumes the baby fell out of a window, then he sees a mother with a child in a pushchair and thinks that this woman could have dropped the other baby. However, he tries to get the woman's attention in vain. That's why Charlie Chaplin simply puts the baby into the lady's pushchair. When the woman finds out that there is another baby in her child's pushchair she becomes very angry and insistes Charlie Chaplin to fetch back the baby. When Charlie Chaplin decides to put the baby back where he had found it he is caught by a policeman. In his next attempt to get rid of the baby Charlie Chaplin tries to give the little child to a man, who carries a walking stick. <br/> The man does not want to be responsible for the baby and puts it again into the woman's pushchair. When the lady discovers that the strange baby is back in her child's pushchair she is very furious, chases Charlie Chaplin, hits him with her umbrella and forces him to fetch back the baby. Eventually, Charlie Chaplin feels so overwhelmed with his duty to care for the child that he considers to throw it into gully. When he discovers a note into the baby's bundle that begs the finder to lovingly care for this orphan Charlie Chaplin changes his opinion and decides to look after the child."

Since he doesn't know what to do with the child, he tries to get rid of the kid, first by putting it into a somebody else's pram, maybe assuming that the child belongs to this woman, who, however, chases them away angrily. When Charlie wants to put the child back to where he found it, a police officer watches him, thinking that Charlie wants to abandon the child. After that Charlie takes off, together with the kid. He meets a passer-by, slipping the child into the passer-by's hand, before taking off again. The man who's got the child now unknowingly puts it into the same pram as Charlie did before. When the woman realizes that the unknown child is back again in her pram, she immediately thinks of Charlie who passes the street at that very moment. After getting beaten up by that lady and while argueing the police officer walks over and Charlie sees himself forced to take the child with him one more time. Then, he sits down on the roadside. When he notices a drain right next to him, he considers to throw the kid into it for a second but he decides not to do it. Shortly after, he finds a note in the child's cloth, saying that this child is an orphan that needs to be taken care of and that needs to be loved.

As he walks on he gets hit by stones coming from above extinguishing his cigar and the Words:""Akward ass"" show up. While grabing and igniting a new cigar he finds a crying baby and tries to find the parents of the baby. The secong after a woman with a pram walks by and immediately Charles puts the baby in the pram saying:""Pardon, me you dropped something."" with a suprising hostile reaction of the woman. Just after the interaction with the lady Charles carries the baby back to the place where he had found  it getting caught by a police officer and nervously picking up the baby again. On his way Charles met an elderly man tricking him into holding the baby whilst he ties his shoes and secretly runs away.While Charles arrived in the mentioned alley hidding from the old man, the old man is seeking for him but finds the pram of the lady Charles met earlier. Then when Charles leaves his hidding spot he gets confronted by the same police officer again and just as he had escaped the policeman Charles walks by the pram while the lady notices that the baby from earlier is yet again in her pram. The lady then sees Charles putting him into dust and dragging him to the pram. Now the policeman had arrived at the pram and both the lady and the policeman are forcing Charles to take the baby. At the end while still searching for a solution for the baby problem Charles finds a note with the writing:""Please love and care for this orphan child"" After sitting on a wayside he stands up smilling the baby in his arms and walks away."

He has to take it back and wants to get rid of it, so he puts it  back on the street where he found it, but a police officer walks by. Therefore the man has to take the baby again with him. He tries to trick an old man to hold the baby while he is pretending to tie his shoes and then runs away. The old man again puts the baby into the baby carriage of the same woman and walks away. The woman is again forcing the man (who picked up the baby in the first place) to take it back, as he is just accidentally passing by again. The man is now sitting down on the street with the baby in his arms and finds a letter within the cloths of the baby. The letter tells him to take good care of this orphan child and so he finally decides to do so.

After a few moments, he notices a woman with a stroller. He assumes it must be her child and lays the baby down. However, it seems like this is not the case and Chaplin has to continue looking for the baby's parents. He figures that they were going to pick the baby up eventually and leaves it where he found it, only to pick it up shortly after. A policeman came around the corner and to ihm, it must've looked like Chaplin was going to leave his own child in the alley. Chaplin then tries to hand the baby to an old man by tricking him to hold it while tying his shoes. He flees from the man, who comes by the lady with the stroller again and, just as Chaplin did before, assumes it's her baby. When the woman comes back to her stroller and the unfamiliar baby, she spots Chaplin walking by and punches him. She then hands him the baby. Chaplin, holding the baby again, sits down on the sidewalk when he notices a piece of paper inbetween the baby's blanket. The child appears to be an orphan and Chaplin smiles, looks at the child and walks away holding it.

While doing so a woman throws her trash out of the window and almost hits him. A few seconds and meters later, an unknown persons who we do not see, does the same and hits him. Charlie is obviously angry and lights a cigarette. Just seconds after that he finds a baby, covered in sheets laying on the ground. He wonders if it was also just thrown out of the window or to whom it belongs. As a woman with a baby carriage passes by he chases her and wants to put it back in there because he believes that she lost one of hers. The woman gets furious as it turns out not to be her child and he walks away with the orphan. Charlie seems to be unable to cope with the situation and tries to get rid of the baby. But as he puts it back to the place where he found it, a policeman catches him and he instantly picks it back up. Still trying to get rid of the baby, he gives it to an old man who can barely walk and runs away. But the old man comes up with the same idea as Charlie did, he puts the baby inside the buggy of the woman. Unfortunately she realizes that the orphan was put in her baby carriage the moment Charlie walks past. She chases him down, beats him up and makes him take the baby. He has no other choice than to do so because the policeman appears again. Frustrated by the situation, Charlie sits down on the curb and even thinks of throwing the orphan in the drain. A few moments later, after finding a letter which says ""please love and care for this orphan child"", his mood suddenly lights up and he feels responsible. At the end he walks away with the baby and disappears in a small side street."

Wondering where it came from, he starts looking around. As he passes some trashcans, he finds a baby laying behind them. He picks it up and holds it close to him. He again starts looking around, now wondering who might left the baby on the floor. A few moments later, a mother with her child in a stroller walk by. He sees this as an opportunity to leave the baby to this mother and puts the baby to hers in the stroller. After realizing what Chaplin has done, the mother angrily tells him to take the baby back. As the mother turned him down, Chaplin just puts the baby back where he found it. In exact this moment, a police officer passes and just watches him. Chaplin realizes that he is being watched and therefore decides to pick the baby up again, so he will not get arrested. He now walks through the neighbor, looking for a solution. When he walks past by a random bystander, he asks him to hold the baby for a moment, but then starts running away and hides. The man who holds the baby now, is confused and puts the baby in the same stroller from the mother, from the beginning of the film. Chaplin, sure about his accomplishment, casually walks by the mother again, but she recognizes him and attacks Chaplin and drags him back to the stroller, asking him to take the baby back. They start to argue, but when the police officer passes again, Chaplin willingly takes the baby back, again to avoid a punishment. It now seems like, that Chaplin gave up. He sits down next to the road while holding the baby. He takes a closer look a founds a letter with the text ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". As he read the text he starts smiling and walks off with the baby in his hands."

After that he noticed a crying baby in the alley. While picking the baby up a woman with a stroller is walking past them. Chaplin notices the stroller and tries to put the baby in the stroller. The woman was furious as Chaplin said that she had dropped something. He had to pick the baby up again because it wasn't the baby of that woman.

Meanwhile a woman with a stroller walks by and Chaplin assumes that the baby belongs to her. He lays it down in the stroller but when the woman sees him she gets angry and tells him to take the baby back. He then takes the child again and wants to put it back to where he found it, but because a policeman is watching him he leaves with the baby in his arms.

The old man then walks through the streets, looking for a way to get rid of the baby. He sees a stroller, put the baby in it and leaves as well. The stroller is the one belonging to the woman Chaplin met before. When she gets out of the store she gets upset because the baby is back with her. At the same time, Charlie Chaplin walks by and she then assumes that he is responsible for it again and hits him with an umbrella. The police man joins the situation and Chaplin better leaves with the baby because the woman accuses him. Without knowing what to do he sits down on the curb. While he is looking at the baby he finds a piece of paper that states that someone should please love and take care of the orphan. Touched by this he stands up and leaves, holding the baby in his arms.

Charlie Chaplin looks confused and tries to figure out who threw them at him. He then grabs a box with cigarettes and lights one with his show. While smoking, he takes closer looks at the surroundings and notices a baby on the ground, laying beside a garbage bin. Slowly, he approaches the bunch and looks at it, before taking it up and holding it in front of his face for closer inspection. He then searches for an opportunity to get rid of the baby and sees a woman with pram, which he then follows in order to lay down the baby in a moment when the woman does not pay attention to him. Unfortunately for him, she sees him and screams at him to take the child away. After that, Charlie Chaplin returns to the garbage bin and puts the baby back on the ground, when a police man appears behind him, urging him to take the baby back in his arms. Charlie Chaplin walks away and takes one last chance to get rid of the child when he gives it away to a beggar, before running away. The beggar looks confused, tries to follow him but can not manage to catch up. Instead, he passes the lady with the pram again, who again is not paying attention. The beggar puts the baby down in the pram, just like Charlie Chaplin did before, then walks away. At the same time when the lady enters the street again and discovers the second baby in the pram, Charlie Chaplin passes her. She confrontates him violently. At the end, Charlie Chaplin accepts the kid on his arm, sits down with it and reads a note that had been written for the person who finds it. ""Please love and care for this orphan child"", it says.

Next thing you see is Charles coming out of his hiding place. He walks past the woman who sees the baby back in her trolley and follows Charles and calls the police officer.

He decides to take the crying baby and put it into the stroller of a woman with another child. The woman gets angry, so Chaplin takes the baby back to the place where he found it. A police officer appears and watches him curiously. Chaplin has no other choice but to take the baby again in his arms and to walk around the corner. When he sees a man walking around, he attempts to hand the baby over to him and to escape. The man follows Chaplin angrily and puts it into the stroller of the mother and disappears quickly. When the mother realizes that the baby sits in her stroller for the second time, she beats Chaplin with her umbrella as he walks by. The police officer appears again, so Chaplin has - again - no other choice but to take the baby with him. So he sits down on the floor and thinks about how to handle this situation. Suddenly he finds a note between the sheets of the baby's clothes. The note says: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". Chaplin smileys and leaves together with the baby."

Chaplin continues walking until he finally is hit by the litter of someone else's dustbin. Between garbage cans, he eventually notices a crying baby, wrapped up in a cloth, which someone must have left there on purpose. Chaplin picks the baby up and looks for someone to whom the baby might belong to. Eventually, a woman passes while pushing a pram with a baby inside. Chaplin assumes that the baby he found on the floor belongs to her and that she obviously must have dropped it without noticing. However, she makes clear that it is not hers and also feels rather offended by Chaplin's assumption. Chaplin takes the baby out of the pram and intends to lay it back to the place where he found it. He stays not unnoticed though as a policeman watches Chaplin. So instead of getting help by the officer, Chaplin prefers to take the baby with him and obviously wants to drop it somewhere else. Then an old stranger with a walking stick comes in handy and Chaplin gives the baby to him and runs away afterwards. The old man,  however, does not want to keep it and is desperately looking for Chaplin to return the baby but without any success. When the old man sees a pram left alone in front of a shop, he sees his chance to get rid of it and finally puts the baby in the pram. As the woman, to whom the pram belongs to, comes out of the shop and notices the  baby she suspects Chaplin again who is, unfortunately, passing the pram right at that moment. After all, Chaplin is given back the baby and keeps it after he found a tag lying between the layers of the cloth saying that the baby is an orphan and needs someone to love and care for it.

Unfortunately, the moment Chaplin walks past the womens‘ carriage, she discovers the baby and assuming that Chaplin has put it again in the carriage, starts hitting him with her umbrella.

He discovers a draining grid and looks at the baby as if he was thinking about putting it in there.Then, he notices a note in the babys‘ clothes which says that the baby is an orphan and demands the finder to love and care for the child. This seems to change Chaplin‘s mind. He holds the baby tight to his chest and walks happily away.

However, he doesn't seem to care and keeps on walking while he smokes a cigarette.

He loses his cigarette but instantly reaches out for another one in his pocket.  <br/> A baby lies hidden next to a different garbage bin in the same backstreet and as Charles Chaplin notices it, he thinks that someone threw the baby out of a window aswell.  <br/> A woman with a baby carriage crosses his way and he says ""Pardon me, you dropped something"". But the woman explains that it isn't her baby.  <br/> During his try to put the baby back to its hiding spot, a policeman walks by and seems angry about it.  <br/> Charles takes the baby and walks down a different street and asks an old man to hold it since he has to retie his shoe. <br/> However, he takes his chance and runs away. The old man tries to follow him and walks by the same baby carriage as Charles did before. He lies the baby down next to the other baby and leaves.  <br/> Charles Chaplin leaves his hiding spot and accidentally crosses the woman with the baby carriage.

In the back a person is throwing things out of the window. A person, presumably Charly Chaplin, walks underneath that window. He realises the things falling down from above, but is not noticeably disturbed by it. He starts smoking and moves into the foreground. Then again, things are falling down from above. A text appears: 'Awkward ass'. Charly Chaplin takes a look into the bin next to him. He pulls a cigarette out of a metal box and puts it into his mouth. The, he takes off his gloves and lits the cigarette. He throws his gloves into the bin. Following his view, we can see a baby laying on the ground next to a wall. Chaplin watches out for people. He picks up the baby and moves into the back. He raises his arm to get the attention of a woman passing by. We see a buggy. Charly Chaplin puts the baby into the buggy. The woman appears and both argue, presumably about who is going to take care of the baby. Charly takes the baby out of the buggy and both persons leave in different directions. As Charly lays down the baby, a policeman arrives. Charly turns around, spots the policeman and picks the baby up again. In a different location we can see a man walking next to Chaplin. Charly indicates that he wants to tie his shoelaces and hands the baby over to the man. Then he runs into the back. The man follows Charly, who hides in a garage. The man lays the baby down into another buggy, in which we can also spot another baby. Then he leaves. Charly comes out of his stash, running into the policeman. He is passing by the buggy with the two babys. The same woman from earlier comes out of a house, sees Charly and follows him. She hits him with an umbrella and then drags him towards the buggy. They start arguing again. The policeman notices the two people arguing. Charly takes the baby out of the buggy again and leaves. He sits down on the sidewalk, shortly considering to throw the baby down the drain. He finds a note in the baby's clothes and reads: 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. Then he looks at the baby and takes it with him.

He grabs into his pocket, pulls out a little box and takes out a cigarette, which he shoves into his mouth. In this moment, he notices a baby laying besides one of the trash cans. He looks around, looking for the parents or any other person, who is responsible for the child. He sees a lady walking by, stops her and puts the baby inside her wagon. The woman is not happy about it and tells him to get the baby out of her wagon, because it is obviously not hers. A policeman is standing beside Chaplin, as he tries to lay the baby back to where he found it, but takes it back from the ground, as he notices that he is being watched by him. Chaplin proceeds trying to find someone, who will take care of the baby, but no one seems to be responsible. In the end, Chaplin sits at the sidewalk and reads a letter, which is attached to the babys blanket. Written there is a begging to whoever finds the child in the street, asking the finder to take care of it, because it's an orphan. Chaplin smiles and walks away, with the baby in his arms.

However, this is not the right mother, so she gets a little angry and he takes the baby back: unfortunately, he takes the wrong baby out of the stroller.

Charlie looks around in order to find out where the baby came from. At that very second a mother pushing a pram passes him. Accordingly, Charlie supposes that the new born belongs to her and puts it in the pram. However, it turns out that the lady is not the baby's mother since she is beside herself with rage. So Charlie takes the baby back. In his desperation he lays the child back on the ground which is seen by a police officer. Again he picks up the new born and hands it to an old man walking down the lane. Charlie grasps his chance, runs off and hides himself. The old man, not knowing what to do, puts the baby back in the pram on the street. The unwitting and relieved Charlie continues his walk down the street and passes the aforesaid pram. The mother discovers the stranger's child, runs after him and hits him with her umbrella. The fight catches the police officer's attention and Charlie picks up the baby. He's sitting down on the pavement, thinking about how to get rid of the child when he finds a note, apparently written by the baby's mother. The note says to please love and care for the orphan which Charlie finally decides to do.

In doing so he suddenly sees a baby lying next to a trash bin. He looks around to find out where the baby could come from. He lifts the baby up and notices a woman pushing a pram. Chaplin considers the woman to be the baby's mother and therefore he follows her and puts the baby into the pram. There is another baby already in there, though. The woman gets mad and makes Chaplin leave and take the child with him. Chaplin tries to get rid of the baby and puts it next to the trash bin where he has found it. At the same time a police officer passes by and Chaplin lifts the baby up again. Then he passes the baby to an old man he meets in the streets, pretending to having to tie his shoe. He runs away and hides from the man. However, the old man cannot find Chaplin but sees a pram standing in front of a shop. There is another baby already in it and the man puts the baby into the pram next to the other child. When a woman leaves the shop it turns out to be the same pram which Chaplin has tried to put the baby into shortly before. Chaplin leaves his hiding place and passes the pram. The mother recognizes him, thinks he was the one who put the baby into the pram again, follows him and hits him with an umbrella. She tries to make him take the baby but he refuses until the police officer arrives whom Chaplin has met before. Chaplin takes the baby, leaves and sits down at a footpath. Next to him there is a drain and he considers whether to put the baby into it but he decides against this.When frisking the cloths the baby has been wrapped in he finds a piece of paper. The letter says that the baby was an orphan and begs the finder to love and take care of it. Chaplin smiles and cuddles the baby and leaves with the baby on his arms.

As he feels obliged to take care of the baby and cannot leave it lying next to a dustbin, he secretly tries to give it to a woman who passes with a pram and her own baby. This attempt to rid himself of the baby fails and thus the protagonist even considers to simply return the baby to the backyard where he found it. However, a police officer watches him and so he gives it to another man who then himself places the unwanted baby in the woman's pram. She suspects the protagonist and accuses him in front of the officer, which results in the protagonist's flight. As he eventually sits down, he finds and reads a piece of paper which was wrapped in the baby's blankets. This note declares that whoever finds this orphan child should care for it. Finally, the protagonist decides to follow the instructions and aquires a taste for being given the responsibility of caring for the abandoned baby."

He proceeds to place the baby into the stroller when the woman becomes mad and demands for him to take it back out, which Chaplin does. He then puts the baby back where he found it just when a police officer walks by. Upon seeing the other man, Chaplin picks up the baby immediately and leaves. Walking around with the baby, he finds an old man whom he gives the baby under the impression of having to lace his shoes, when suddenly he runs away. The old man, certainly as unbothered by the small child, happens to run into the stroller of the woman as well, placing the baby into it then and walking away from the scene. Chaplin meanwhile unintentionally runs into the woman and the stroller again, who becomes mad at an instant and demands him to take out ""his"" baby. The police officer happens to stand close by. Realizing this, Chaplin takes the baby and leaves. In the next scene, Chaplin sits down, looking defeated, the child in his arms. He finds a letter of a simple request: to take care of the orphan and to love it. Chaplin smiles at the child and walks off with it."

In the very same moment a woman walks by pushing a child's pushchair in front of her. He runs after her, however, before being able to reach her, the woman enters the building in the alley from which the items where thrown. Carles Chaplin then puts the baby into the pushchair. Meanwhile, the woman exits the house and observes Chaplin's action. Angrily, she approaches him, and the only thing that the recipient can see is a black screen with the words: ""Pardon me, you've dropped something"". The woman steams up and furiously says something that cannot be heard. Chaplin then almost takes the wrong baby out of the pushchair. However, he is reminded by the woman that he took the wrong human being. He puts it back, takes the baby that he found next to the barrels and walks away. The barrels is the place where he goes to next, to return the baby. A police man appears, stops with a stern look on his face and Charles Chaplin takes the small creature back into his arms and followingly he is seen in a different street. Here, another man with a walking aid can be perceived. Chaplin puts the baby into the man's arms and runs away. Carrying th baby, the man follows him. However, Chaplin manages to hide in a shed.

He then tried to lay the Baby back in the streets but while doing so he was interupted by a police officer. Shortly after he met an old man, who he kindly asked to hold the Baby for a minute, and ran off. Unfortunetaly the old man passed the Lady with the other Baby again and put the Baby in her stroller. She then recognized Charlie in the streets shortly after and, joined by the same police officer, who entered the scenery due to coincidence, Charlie had no choice but to take the Baby back. The film comes to a close when Charlie found a letter with the Baby saying that somebody please love the orphan child. The final scene of the film shows Charlie adopting the baby eventually."

It deals with the issue of responsibility. The protagonist Charlie suddenly finds a baby in an absent corner beside some bins. He takes the baby and tries to hand it to several other people which he meets on the streets. As he does not know to whom the baby belongs, he hands it to several other passer-bys. For instance, Charlie tries to put the baby into a baby buggy of a woman, who reacts impulsive and aggressive. She hands the baby straight back to him. To conclude, he does not know where to take the baby, for all his tries to get rid of the newborn failed. Therefore he sits down with it and finds a small letter.

Chaplin	written_online	30	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English)	In a rather trash-filled ally, were people do not care about the waste and trash they are throwing out of the window on the streets, the Tramp, played by actor Charles Chaplin is taking a walk. A few moments later he finds a little baby, wrapped in blankets laying on the ground in a little corner. Chaplin looks up to the balcony which causes for comedic effect. He seems to think that someone had thrown out their child, just like they are throwing out trash out of the balcony. He immediatly takes the baby and tries to find it's mother or father. He tries to find someone he can give the baby to. After seeing a woman with a stroller, he assumes that the baby belongs to the woman eventhough there was already a baby in the stroller. He carefully places the child in the stroller and tries to get out of the situation as politely as possible. He even says: ''you dropped something'' and is tipping his head, like he has done something admirable. But the woman is not accepting that child and gives the baby back to Chaplin. His second idea is to simply place the baby back to where he found it. On the street, right next to a trash can. This plan is quickly interrupted by the police officer passing by. He is not asking why Chaplin is trying to put the baby there, he simply gives him a look and Chaplin takes the baby and goes away. His third plan is to give the baby to a man he sees on the street. He told the man that he has to tie his shoe and as soon as the man takes the child, Chaplin runs away. The man, holding the baby in his arms sees the woman with the stroller and, like Chaplin just places the baby in the stroller and runs away. Chaplin is passing by that woman a moment later and she immediatly recognizes him and is furious. She even smacks him on his head and gives him back the baby. In that moment, the tramp was visibly desperate. He did not know what to do with the baby so he just sat on the sidewalk. Unwrapping the child a little bit, he discovers a note that says ''love this orphan child''. After that he gives the baby a little hug, gets up and goes his own way. He is not looking for anyone he can give the baby anymore. He is taking it with him.

He proceeds on his way smoking a cigarette when suddenly a pile of rubble falls down on him from above. Seemingly annoyed he looks for another cigarette as his previous one fell on the floor with the rubble. Before he starts to continue walking he spots a baby on the side of a building, he acts confused and it seems as he were looking for the child's parents. He then sees a woman walking by with a buggy. The woman leaves the buggy standing by the side of a building to go inside, Charles Chaplin uses the time to put the child he found in the buggy next to the woman's but she caught him in the act and asks him angrily to remove the second child from the buggy. He now looks for other ways to get rid of the child, at first, he tries to put it back where he found it but a policeman sees it, afterwards he hands it to another man he sees walking around. Said man now looks for a place for the child in Charles Chaplin's place, sees the woman's unattended buggy and places the child in it. Mr. Chaplin, now happy that he does no longer have to look after the child, walks past the building next to which the buggy still stands. The woman comes back to the buggy and sees the second, unwanted child. She wonders where it came from and sees Charles Chaplin. She runs after him and beats him up with her umbrella, forcing him to take back the child. Mr. Chaplin walks away with the child and sits down on the kerb. He sees a sewer next to him and thinks about dropping the child in it. He does not seem very convinced of this idea though, so he takes a closer look at the child. Doing that, he finds a letter saying, ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". The letter moves him and changes his attitude towards the child immediately, he starts to smile and walks away happily with the child in his arm."

Chaplin is confused and when in that very same moment a mother pushing a stroller passes him, he connects the dots and assumes that she dropped the baby. The woman is indignant and tells Chaplin to take the baby back when he puts it into the stroller with her own baby. He goes to put the baby back in the spot where he found it but a police officer catches him in the act. Chaplin flees the scene with the baby in his arms and catches a man walking when he turns the corner. He hands the baby over to him under the pretence of tying his shoes but then he promptly runs away, leaving the baby behind. In his quest to get rid of the baby, the man finds the stroller from Chaplin's previous encounter and puts the baby inside while the mother is nowhere to be found. In a fate of bad luck, Chaplin passes that very same stroller and the mother, who has now returned, assumes that Chaplin put the baby back inside. She drags him to the stroller and makes him take the baby back again with the help of the police officer. Chaplin, who considers throwing the baby into the sewer for a short moment, sits down and finds a letter between the cloth the baby is wrapped up in. The note begs the reader to “love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin seems to be touched by this and the music transitions into a happier melody when he finally smiles at the baby. The video ends with Chaplin leaving the scene with the baby in his arms.

He then lits himself a cigarette only to find a baby lying next to the trashcan. The man checks if there is anyone around whom the baby maybe belong to but hes not able to spot anyone until a woman with a baggy comes down the alley. With her having still space left in the baggy, the man assumes that the baby might belong to her and puts it in the baggy. The woman then refuses to take the baby, probably claiming its not her own.   While the man tries to bring the baby back to the place he found it, a police officer walks by and spots him  so the man stops his doing and continues walking. When he sees a man walking with a sick, he ask if he could hold the baby for him so he can tie his shoes. Being freed he rans off and leaves the baby and hides in the alley. The man with the stick tries to find him but instead discovers the abandoned baggy and places the baby inside. Meanwhile the man has to leave his cover because the police office is walking in his direction. He passes the baggy just when the Woman returns to her babby and notices the second baby. The woman rans after him and hits him with an Umbrella, and gets him to go back to the baggy but the man refuses to take the baby. But the woman sees the police officer walking down the streets and tries to make notice of the argument going on between her and the man. The man immediately picks up the baby and leaves the scene. He then sits down on the curb thinking about pushing the baby down the gutter but he doesnt. He spots a note claiming that the person who finds the baby hopefully loves and takes care for the baby.After a while he walks down the same alleyway he came from  still holding the baby.

He picks up the kid and tries to figure out where it came from. At first, he possibly thinks that it belongs to a woman with another child in her pram, so he lays the baby into that pram, which leads to the angry woman shouting furiously at Chaplin. He then wants to lay the baby back to where he'd found it, but, being watched by a policeman, picks it up again and takes it with him onto the street where he then gives the baby to an old man. Chaplin escapes quickly and the old man again wants to get rid off the baby by putting it into the same woman's pram as before. The woman, again presuming that Chaplin laid it in there, runs after him and punches him on the head with an umbrella.

Chaplin apparently decides to do just that and walks away with the baby."

He is wearing a suit and a hat, carrying a walking stick. The second time a person dropped rubbish on Chaplin trough the window, he was angry and started coursing at this person saying: 'Awkward ass'. After this he lit up his cigarette and walked on. Suddenly, he found a crying baby so he picked it up and put it into the pram of a woman that just walked by saying to her: 'Pardon me, you dropped something.', which shows that he is being polite and slightly rude at the same time as he is assuming that the baby belongs to the woman. The woman complained so Chaplin took the baby again and put it back to where he found it. What he didn't realize was that he has been watched by a policeman so Chaplin had to take the baby into his arms again. When another man, who was older than Chaplin, passed by, Chaplin gave him the baby and ran away. This man put the baby back into the woman's pram which stood outside a store. When the woman came out of the store and discovered the second baby in her pram she was annoyed and started to get angry. Chaplin walked by her and she couldn't help herself but attacking him as well as showing him why she did so. The policeman walked by and the woman complained to him about Chaplin who ended up carrying the baby with him again. Sitting down in the edge of the sidewalk beside a drain, he was thinking about dropping the baby there but hesitated as it was most likely to be the child's death sentence. Then he found a letter in between the child's clothes, which he began to read. It said: 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. Chaplin put the piece of paper into his chestpocket and looked at the baby. In the end, he got up and walked away with the baby carried safely in his arms.

Suddenly bricks fell down on him from above, which turned his cigarette off. While lighting up a new cigarette, he discovers a baby beside a garbage can. He assumes that the baby belongs to a woman with a stroller, who walkes by in that moment. Consequently, he puts the baby inside the stroller but the woman gets angry and forces him to take the baby back. Afterwards, he tries to lay the baby back down beside the garbage can but a police officer happens to overlook the scene, forcing him to take the baby back into his arms. After noticing an elderly man walking by, he forcefully makes the man take the baby and walks away. The man coincidentelly discovers the same woman with the stroller from before and puts the baby into the stroller without the woman noticing. When Chaplin walks by again, the woman sees the baby in the stroller and angrily forces him to take the baby again under the watchfull eyes of the police officer. After shortly thinking about puting the baby into the drain channel, Chaplin gives up and discovers a letter inside the blanket in which the baby is wrapped up which notifies him that the baby is an orphan. Shortly after reading that Chaplin happily decides to keep the baby.

The obviously poverty stricken neighborhood is heavily littered and people have no shame throwing trash out of their windows. Mr. Chaplin is repeatedly hit by named trash. After his cigar is lost in one of the incidents, he stops to light a cigarette. It is at this moment that he realizes an infant laying on the ground. He picks the baby up and puts it in a stroller of a passerby. The Lady calls him out and Mr. Chaplin again has to take possession of the little one. He thinks about putting the baby back where he found it but is stopped by a police officer. In an attempt to ditch the infant he asks an older gentleman to hold the baby so he can tie his shoes. Mr. Chaplin takes advantage of the situation and runs away. The older gentleman then decides to put the infant in the stroller of the Lady who previously had called out Mr. Chaplin. The Lady who had parked the stroller in front of a store comes back out and sees Mr. Chaplin, who coincidentally happened to walk past store and hits him with an umbrella. And again, Mr. Chaplin has to take possession of the baby. Desperate and out of options Mr. Chaplin sits down holding the baby in his arms. He finds a note hidden in the babies clothing. The note says that the baby is an orphan who needs to be loved. Mr. Chaplin immediately falls in live with the little bugger and walks away happily.

The residents throw their rubbish out of the window and onto the street, hitting the strolling man in the process. The man loses his cigarette as a results and decides to fetch another one from his cigarette box and light it. At that moment he notices a baby, wrapped in cloth, lying on the pavement next to a bin. He picks it up and looks for the rightful owner. He sees a woman with a buggy passing by and decides to approach her. The man puts the baby in her buggy and tells her that she dropped something. Upon her infuriated reaction he takes the baby from the pram and puts it back on the pavement, where he found it earlier on. A police officer catches him in the act and the man picks the baby up again to avoid any trouble. On his now continued search for the respective parent he spots an old man with a long beard. The man walks up to the bearded pedestrian and asks him to hold the baby, so that he can tie his shoes. The old man takes the baby and our main character makes a quick getaway and hides. The bearded man chases after him but cannot catch up. He sees a buggy without an owner and inconspicuously lays the baby in it. The main character comes out of hiding and continues his way. Coincidentally he walks past that buggy at the same time the woman owning the buggy comes out of a building and notices the baby that does not belong to her. She sees the men from the beginning and concludes that he must have put it in the pram again. She chases after him and hits him with the umbrella she was carrying. They both argue with each other when the police officer from the beginning walks past them and notices the fuss. Just like earlier the man takes the baby to avoid any further conflict. He gives up his search and sits down on the pavement. He looks at a manhole next to, opens it, looks at the child and shortly considers throwing the child away. The man dismisses that thought and finds a note likely saying: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"" shortly after. After reading the note, the man looks at the child again but this time with a content and caring look. The scene ends with the man walking out of the picture."

He stops and opens a little box that seems to contain half-smocked cigares and cigarettes. In the following, the man uses a match to lighten a cigar, before starting to smoke it. All of his gestures are exaggerated, which adds to the all in all comedic feeling of the video.  <br/> Suddenly, he turns around and finds an infant, who is swaddled in a blanket beneath a trashcan. The man picks the baby up and looks around and up into the sky, seemingly wondering where the baby came from. He sees a woman with a baby in a stroller passing by and places the found infant in her stroller, telling her that she has dropped something. Meanwhile, the woman, starts shouting  and arguing. Devastated, the man takes the baby out of the stroller and the now angry woman walks of with her child. <br/> In the next scene, the man tries to lay the baby down next to the trashcan, where he has found it earlier, when a police officer passes by and sees it. Probably thinking the man just tries to get rid of his baby, he scolds him. The man leaves quickly with the baby.  <br/> In the following scene the man finds an old man, walking slowly with the help of a walking cane. He gestures at the eldery man to hold the baby, while he acts as if he is tying his shoe laces, before quickly running off.  <br/> The man, followed by the eldery man,  runs away and finally hides in a big container. The eldery man cannot find him and is left with the baby, until he sees another baby in a stroller in front of a store. He quickly drops of the baby and walks away. In this moment, the police officer is passing by.  <br/> When a woman exits the store it is visible that it is the same woman that appeared earlier in the clip. She sees the young man passing by and starts attacking him, thinking that he placed the baby into her stroller again.  <br/> The police officer notices the argument and stops by. After the women explained the situation the young man quickly picks up the baby again.  <br/>  <br/> Finally, he sits down with the baby in his arms. Underneath him, there is an utility hole. He debates throwing the baby away, when suddenly he finds a note in the baby's swaddle. The note says ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".  <br/>  <br/> In the last scene the man looks at the baby and stands up, finally accepting his fate."

Chaplin, not wanting to take care of a random baby he found, simply hands it over to some old man on the street and runs away. The old man is not able to find Chaplin, and by pure coincidence puts the child in the same buggy Chaplin tried earlier. The policemans presence forces Chaplin to take the same way the old man did making him walk past by the buggy. The woman notices him and beats him up with her umbrella. Unwillingly taking back the baby he is unsure what to do with it but after finding a note of the mother inside the blankets the baby is covered in, he decides to take care of the child.

On the left, next to a trashcan, he sees an infant and picks it up. In this moment, a woman with a stroller walks into frame and down the opposite side of the alley. The man notices her, follows her and tried to get her attention. When woman stops, the man places the infant inside of the stroller and talks to her. Apparently the infant does not belong to the woman, because she rejects it and returns it to the man. After that the man walks back the spot where he found the infant and lays it down. Just in that moment a police officer appears in the frame. The man notices the police officer and picks the infant back up and walks away. In the next shot, we see the man walking down a street and meeting another man. The first man gives the infant to the second man and runs away. The second man tries to pursue the first man, who at this point is hiding in a shack. When the second man fails to find the first man, he notices a stroller on the side of the street and lays the infant down in the stroller. After that, he runs away. In the next shot, the first man leaves the shack and meets the police officer once again and walks away. In another shot, a woman appears in the frame next to the stroller and sees the infant. In this moment the first man walks past her and she pursues him and knocks him down with an umbrella. She keeps hitting the man with the umbrella and forces him back to the stroller, where they start arguing. In the next shot, the police officer appears again and walks towards the man and the woman. After a short period of time, the man picks up the infant and walks away. After a while, the man stops and sits down on the sidewalk. While he is sitting there, he thinks about dropping the infant into a gutter, he quickly abandons that thought. In the next moment, he attempts to pet the infant, but the infant bites him. In the next moment, the man inspects the infant clothing and notices a note. The note reads ""Please liv and care for this orphew [sic!] child"". After reading the note, the man pets the infant again and walks away."

Chaplin is walking through the streets and tries to avoid the garbage that is thrown out of the windows. After he was showered with old vegetables from a window above, he wants to smoke a cigarette but a baby that is lying behind a garbage bin is stopping him. He searches for the mother and thinks that a woman with a baby stroller is the mother but soon he finds out that she’s not because she starts to argue with him, as soon as he places the infant into her carrier. Chaplin wants to put the baby back next to the garbage bin but a police officer catches him and he has to stick to the child. After that he  gives the baby to an old man pretending his shoelaces are open and running away. The old man places the baby into the baby carrier of the woman, who is not the mother, after chasing after Chaplin. Chaplin is caught by the same woman and they argue until she calls the police officer and Chaplin takes the baby back. Desperate, he sits on the road curb and thinks about dumping the baby into the sewer but he finds a letter attached to the baby, which says that the finder should care for this orphan baby. Chaplin seems touched by this and takes the baby with him.

She realizes his action and hands him back the baby. Subsequently Chaplin puts back the baby where he found it but is observed by a police officer. Realizing he cannot leave the baby there he takes it and walks the streets carrying it in his arms. He then asks a man to hold the baby for a minute so he can tie his shoe. After the man took the child from him, Chaplin runs away and hides. The man tries to find him but fails. Thus, he places the baby in the buggy of the same lady Chaplin placed it in before. The lady discovers the child at the exact same moment Chaplin, who came out of his hideout, walks by. She recognizes him and hits him with her umbrella and makes him pick up the baby with help of the police officer. Chaplin then sits down on the curb and thinks about throwing the baby in the drain. However, he decides not to and discovers a letter hidden under the baby's blanket. The letter says that the child is an orphan and its finder should love the child and take care of it. After reading the letter, he smiles and takes the child with him.

He picks up the baby, wanting to go looking for its parent, when a woman with a baby stroller comes walking by. Chaplin catches up to the stroller, but the woman has temporarily left. He places the baby inside, when suddenly the woman emerges again, claiming it is not her baby and he should take it back. The woman walks away and Chaplin returns to the point where he originally found the small child. He places the baby back on the ground, when a police man appears behind him, observing this. Immediately, Chaplin takes the baby and walks off. He comes upon an old man, with a walking stick. Under the pretense that Chaplin has to tie his shoelaces, he gives the man the baby. Instead of taking it back, Chaplin runs away. He hides from the old man. The old man comes looking for him and finds a baby stroller. Here he puts the baby and walks away. Chaplin emerges from his hideout. He walks by the baby stroller and is spotted by the woman, who, upon realizing the baby is once again in her stroller, proceeds to beat Chaplin with her umbrella. The police man notices the two arguing and approaches. Chaplin once again decides to pick up the baby. He walks away and sits down on the side of the road.

The man is hit by a few pieces of the material albeit the most part of it misses him. However, a few meters below the alley, the protagonist encounters a similar situation in that someone throws waste out of a window which eventually hits him directly and causes him to stop. After removing the remaining waste from his suit and lighting a cigarette, the man discovers a crying baby inside a bundle of blankets next to a trash can. This discovery astonishes the protagonist: He looks around in an effort to determine the source of baby.  <br/> In the same moment, a woman with a pushchair enters the scene - she pushes her pushchair up the street the man just came down. The man discovers the pushchair and concludes that the woman must have dropped the baby. He thus carries the baby over to the the pushchair in order to bed the child into the pushchair. His deed, however, infuriates the woman as she denies to have dropped the baby. As result, the protagonist takes again the baby into his arms an walks back to place the baby next to the crash can where he originally discovered the baby.  <br/> Unfortunately, this situation is observed by a police man which just entered the scene. Afraid of the police officer, the protagonist takes the baby into his arm again and walks away. In a neighbouring street, the protagonist asks an old man to hold the baby for a few seconds as he pretends he has to tie his shoes. Instead of tying his shoes, however, he flees the scene and hides behind a door. The old man tries to pursue the protagonist but is to slow. However, he discovers the same pushchair the protagonist has discovered earlier and beds the baby in it.  <br/> When the woman returns to her pushchair, she observes immediately that the baby was placed again inside her pushchair. In the same moment, the protagonist passes her: She follows him and beats him down with her umbrella. The woman forces him to return to the pushchair and demands the removal of the additional child in it. The two discussing parties are joined by the police officer which eventually results in the man carrying the baby away. After a few meters, he sits down on the kerbstone. The protagonist briefly considers to throw the baby into a gully, but discards this option. The baby is then closer scrutinised by the protagonist. His examination reveals a note: ""Please love and care for this orphan child'. Finally, the protagonist seems to adopt the child and walks out of the scene."

He seems annoyed and lights a cigarette. When smoking, he discovers that an infant baby is lying on the ground near him. He picks it up and tries to sneak it into the buggy of a woman that is walking by him. She spots his attempt and tells him that he dropped something, so he takes the baby again. Chaplin then tries to put it back at the place where he found the baby, but a policemen witnesses him doing so, which leads to Chaplin picking up the baby again. Afterwards he tricks an old man into holding the baby and runs away. The old man then puts the baby into the buggy of the woman that walked by Chaplin earlier on. She discovers the infant in her buggy while Chaplin is strolling by and beats Chaplin up with her umbrella. He then takes the baby again and sits down with it by the sidewalk. He finds a letter inside the blanket of the baby which says that it is an orphan child. After understanding the situation of the baby he smiles at it and walks away while holding it in his arms.

In a corner, Charlie finds an abandoned child. When he sees a woman passing by pushing a pushchair, he concludes that she propably lost the baby or at least will know what to do with it. He calls her and puts the baby into the pushchair, but the woman protests and explains that he misinterpreted something. Charlie leaves with the child in his arms. Leaving it in the corner where he found it turns out to be a bad idea, as a policeman approaches and signals him to take care of the baby. Then an elderly man passes by. Charlie asks him to hold the child for him, pretending to lace his shoes. Instead, he runs away and hides. The elderly man notices the pushchair parked outside of a shop and leaves the baby there. In the meantime, Charlie leaves his hiding place. The approaching policeman blocks his way, so he turns and walks in the direction of the shop. Having passed by the pushchair, he gets stopped by the woman who left the shop and sees the baby in her pushchair. The starting dispute calls the policeman's attention. Charlie ends up with the baby in his arms. Desperate, he sits down, consideres shortly disposing of the baby in the gutters. Having a closer look at this unwanted bundle, he discoveres a piece of paper slipped into the clothes of the baby. It is a little letter, asking to love and to take care of the orphan. This warms Charlie's heart, and he finally accepts the baby as his responsability.

After he has lit another cigaret, he notices a newborn, laying on the ground, next to some rubbish. He picks it up and looks around, trying to figure out where it came from or who it might belong to. A woman with a pram appears. While she leaves it unsupervised for a moment, Charlie puts the baby in it, thinking he has found the mother. The woman, however, notices him and is scandalized, for this child is not hers. Charlie quickly takes the baby, and walks back to the spot where he has found it. His plan, to put the newborn back to where he found it, fails, as a police officer walks by and sees him. Charlie quickly walks away and fools an elderly man to think, he needs to tie his shoe, and gives him the baby. He then runs away. The man is not as fast as him, for he limps, and loses Charlie out of sight. He passes the pram of the woman, though, and puts the baby in it.

As he smokes a cig he discovers a baby lying on the ground beneath the trash cans, wrapped in rags. Assuming that its parents forgot it there, he starts to search for them. When a woman with a baby carriage walks by, he puts the findling in the carriage, but the woman gets worked up because it is not hers. Chaplin decides to put it back where he found it, but then an officer notices him, thinking that Chaplin is about to abandon his child. As that would turn him into a bad person, he has to find another place for the child. An old man is his next victim, he palms it off on him. The old man then again tracks down the same carriage and Chaplin, walking by finally free from the burden, is being made responsible as the woman recognizes him as she returns to the scene. Unfortunately, the officer is back again, so he needs to take back the baby. Pondering on the curb, he finds a note in the bundle, saying that the founder should take care of the orphan.

After hesitating for just a second, Chaplin proceeds on his way until he is hit by trash from another window further down the alleyway which knocks a cigarette out of his mouth. The text ""Awkward ass"" appears on the screen, as Chaplin looks above him and shortly after he searches his cigarette case for a new one. Chaplin pulls one out, sticks it in his mouth and then pulls out a match which he lights on his shoe. After taking the first hit of his cigarette, Chaplin notices a newborn to his left next to whats looks like a trashcan of some sort. He then inspects it for a couple of seconds and takes a look around him before picking the newborn up. A lady with a stroller walks past him and he shouts after her, before laying the baby into the stroller. Another text pops up, saying: ""Pardon me, you dropped something"". Chaplin points at the baby as he walks away but the lady insists that the baby is not hers. After picking up the wrong child at first, Chaplin is corrected by the lady and picks up the baby he found earlier and leaves the now certainly angry lady. He returns the baby to the place he found it, not noticing the police officer standing behind him. Chaplin then turns around, notices the police officer and quickly picks the baby up again, walking around the corner where a man with visible physical problems walks down the street. The man is handed the baby by Chaplin under the excuse of tieing his shoelaces, before he quickly runs away. The old man tries to chase Chaplin, who quickly hid behind a corner. After a few seconds, the old man finds the same stroller Chaplin found before and lays the baby inside it. When coming out of his hiding place, Chaplin runs into the police officer and quickly turns around, running directly to the lady with the stroller. After ignoring her, she chases him and knocks him to the ground with an umbrella. She grabs him by his jacket and pulls him right back to her stroller, and after a few seconds of arguing over the baby the police officer joins them. Chaplin then picks the baby up again, drops his walking stick and sits down on the sidewalk. He then opens an manhole and thinks about dropping the baby inside it, but quickly comes to the decision not to do it. Shortly after, Chaplin finds a note in the sheets the baby is covered in, which says:""Please love and care for this orphan child"". Afterwards, he inspects and plays with the child for a brief moment, before standing up happily and taking the child with him."

Throughout the rest of the clip he tries to get rid of it by tricking other people into taking it. These include a woman, who already had a baby, and an old man. Each attempt to get rid of the baby fails, even leaving it in the place he found it, since an officer caught him doing so. The clip ends with Chaplin finding a piece of paper in the baby's blanket on which the plea to care for the orphaned baby is written

Whilst he is having a smoke break he finds an infant abandoned next to him. He presumes that the child must come from a mother that's passing by and pushing around a large trolly with another infant. It turns out that the infant is not hers and she send the man away furious with the accusation that she would forget a child on the side of the road. The man returns to the spot where he found the child and tries to just abandon it there again, but a police officer is watching him closely. So our protagonist moves onward with the child and sees some man walking along the road. Promply he attempts to get rid of the responsibility by pretending to need to tie his shoelaces so he would hold the baby but instead he runs away and escapes before the second man can catch up. The second man is now tasked with the infant and discovers the trolley of the aforementioned mother and he puts the child in the trolley when she is not paying attention and flees the scene. The Woman returns and is furious to find the child once again in her trolley as our protagonist happens to pass by she wails on him with her umbrella and makes him take back the child he briefly got rid of. Defeated our protagonist takes a rest on the sidewalk. As he does he finds a slip of paper tugged away in the rags of the infant. On the paper it is written that the child is an orphan and the plea to care for it. The protagonist gets up with the child and moves somewhere unknown as the film ends.

A window opens and somebody throws several pieces of garbage out, missing Chaplin every time. Chaplin keeps strolling, not noticing anything. Another window opens, somebody throws out a big amount of garbage, apparently aiming at the trash can standing underneath the window. The garbage lands on Chaplin instead. He's startled and apparently feels awkward, so he takes off his gloves and lights himself a cigarette. Not wanting to put his gloves back on, he throws them into the trash can and leaves. At the corner of the street he finds a baby lying on the ground, crying. He picks it up, gazes at the houses surrounding him. Just at that moment a mother with a child in a stroller walks by and enters a house, leaving the stroller in front of the open door. Chaplin puts the baby into the stroller when the mother comes back. She seems furious, aggressively asks him to take the baby back. Chaplin grabs the baby, they both leave in opposite directions. Chaplin goes back to the corner where he found the baby, puts it on the ground. At that moment, a police officer walks by and witnesses Chaplin leaving the baby. Chaplin attempts to leave the place, turns around, sees the police officer, picks up the baby again and leaves. Next scene. An old man with a walking stick walks down a street, Chaplin is approaching from behind. He pretends that he needs to tie his shoe, gives the baby to the man, then runs away, hiding behind a corner. The old man runs after him. When he can't find him, he notices a stroller standing in front of a house. He puts the baby into the stroller and leaves. Moments later, when Chaplin accidentally walks by, the mother comes out of the house, seeing an additional baby in the stroller and Chaplin walking by. She gets furious again, runs after him and beats him with her umbrella. They argue over the baby in the stroller, when the police officer walks by. The woman gesticulates wildly. Chaplin picks up the baby again and leaves. Next scene. Chaplin sits down on the pavement, a gully next to him. He opens it, pparently thinking about dropping the baby down the gully. He discards the idea and examines the babie's clothes instead, finding a note. The note says ""Please love and care for this orphaned child"". Chaplin looks at the babie's face, smiles, gets up and leaves with the baby."

He picks up the baby and is convinced that he has found the mother when he sees a woman with a buggy walking by. Indicating that it is not her baby, the woman refuses to take the child. The protagonist puts the baby down on the ground and apparently wants to walk off when a police officer enters the scene whereupon the protagonist changes his mind and picks up the baby again. In an attempt to solve the situation, the protagonist hands the baby over to a stranger in the streets and runs off. Irritated, the stranger tries to chase the protagonist but as he is not able to find him he puts the baby in a buggy of a woman, who, by conincidence, is the same woman from the scene in the beginning. When she sees the protagonist passing by, she runs after him and hits him with her umbrella, obviously convinced that he again had put the baby in the buggy. In the final scene of the video, after comtemplating to drop the baby in the sewerage, the protagonist finds a note on the baby saying that the child is an orphan that needs love and caring. The protagonist seems to changes his mind and walks off with the baby and a smile on his face.

After lighting his cigar he sees a baby laying between the garbage cans nearby. Willing to get rid of the child he tries to put it in a stroller of a strange woman, who, however is chasing him away. An attempt to put the baby back to where he found it is interrupted by a policeman and fails, so that the man then tries to trick a passerby into taking care of the child. The passerby however then puts the baby in the stroller in which it was previously laid and leaves. When the woman recognizes this she places the baby in the care of the first man to be introduced, who is unfortunately passing her, with the help of the policeman. The man sits down on the pavement and finds a letter inside the baby's clothes, informing him that the baby is orphaned. Upon getting to know this the man seems touched and rocks the child lovingly.

What follows is his struggle to find someone to take care of the baby: First of all he tries to hand the baby to a woman passing by with a pram. However, she angrily refuses to take it. That's why he sees no other possibilty than putting the baby back to where he initially found it, but as a police officer enters the scene, Choplin has to leave with the baby. In his following attempts to find someone else to look after the little kid, he puts it in the arms of a random stranger and then runs away. This elder man, now being in the same situation as Choplin before, also discovers the pram and decides to put the baby in there. The woman, just leaving the neighbouring building, finds the baby again in her pram. As Choplin coincidentally passes by, she assumes it was him who left the baby there. He gets beaten up by the woman with an umbrella and is forced to take the kid back. Choplin considers leaving it in the canalisation, however, he feels conflicted and hesitates. He then discovers a note hidden in the blanket wrapped around the baby. It says ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". Choplin thus decides to take care of the little kid himself and leaves with the baby on his arms."

Chaplin	written_online	40	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English)	In the video you can see Charlie Chaplin casually walking down a street, smoking a cigarette. Almost being hit by an object which appears to be a brick, that a lady has thrown out of a window located right above his head, he has to take a step to the side. He keeps on walking and only a few seconds later he actually does get hit by another item that has been thrown out of the window. It is not easy to tell what the aforementioned object is but it looks like a bundle of branches and leaves. A little text pops up saying 'awkward ass'. Chaplin looks up to the window and then takes a box of cigarettes and cigars out of his jacket's inside pocket. He eventually takes out a cigarette and lights it after having taken off his leather gloves. He discards the taken off gloves and he discovers a baby lying in the corner of the street, wrapped in a blanket, screaming. Chaplin looks up in confusion assuming that the baby has been dropped out of a window as well and he picks it up. With the baby in his arms he struts to a lady's pushchair, which already has one child in it, and he carefully puts the new found infant in it too. Another text pops up saying 'Pardon me! You dropped something'. The woman, who did not see Chaplin at first, now spots him and furiously starts an argument. As a consequence, Chaplin now takes back the child and attempts to put it back to the place where he found it in the first place. However, this was prevented by a policeman looking at him strictly. Chaplin gives him an apologising look and picks up the baby again. He marches around the corner with the baby in his hands and sees an old man with a walking stick. Chaplin asks the man to hold the baby so that he could tie his shoelaces. He bends down but when the man did not look, Chaplin hurries away with the old man following him. Having lost sight of Chaplin, the elderly man finds the pushchair and places the baby in it, just like Chaplin attempted to do it earlier in the video. Leaving his hiding place, Chaplin encounters the police officer again and changes his direction to not have to pass him. Now the woman sees the second baby lying in the pushchair again and looks around trying to find the person being guilty of this. Coincidentally Chaplin walks past the lady in this exact moment and the women, recognising Chaplin from the earlier incident, knocks him down with her umbrella. After a heated discussion between these two, the police officer joins them but he remains silent. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby again and sits down with it on the pavement. He thinks about throwing the baby into the sewers but then reconsiders. In the end he finds a note that has been attached to the baby's blanket saying 'please love and care for this orphan child'. Looking at the baby's complexion, he smiles and leaves taking the baby with him.

He picks it up carefully and decides to place it in a baby carriage of a woman standing nearby. As he makes an attempt to do so, telling the woman that she dropped something, the woman gets angry. Chaplin picks the baby up reluctantly and puts it exactly in the same place he found it. A police officer approaching behind Chaplin causes him to pick the baby up once more. On his way through the alleys he gives the foundling to an old man quickly running away. By chance, the old man places the baby in the same baby carriage in which Chaplin had already put it. As the owner comes out of the shop before which the baby carriage had stood unobserved, she sees the baby. Chaplin who walks by that moment is persuaded by the woman and the approaching police officer to take the baby with him a last time. Defeated in his trys to hand over the baby to someone else Chaplin sits down on the sidewalk. A short moment he thinks about putting the baby into the drain. Followed by his decision not to do so, Chaplin finds a note hidden in the babyˋs blankets asking the finder to care for the orphan child. Chaplin walks away cradling the baby gently.

He picks it up and tries to get rid of it. A woman with a child in a buggy walks by. The man thinks the baby belongs to her and places the baby in the buggy. The woman, however, becomes angry and hands the baby back to the man. He walks back to where he found the baby and places it on the ground again.

After a few meters he eventually gets hits by trash and starts to complain. Afterwards he lights a cigarette to calm down and starts to notice a baby which is laying near some trash bins. He picks the baby up and wrongly assumes that it belongs to a passing woman who has a stroller. After putting the baby in the stroller, the woman complains and Charles picks the baby up again. The moment he put the baby back to where he found it, a police officer notices him. Out of guilt Charles picks up the baby again immediately. Under the excuse of having to tie his shoe, he gets an old man to hold the baby but runs away shortly after. The old man is following him angrily but lost him and notices a nearby standing stroller. He puts the baby inside and leaves. Charles left his hiding spot and was forced to move into the same direction as the old man was previously because of a nearby police officer. As Charles passes the stroller, the woman, which he angered earlier, comes out and notices the baby. She assumes that Charles put it inside her stroller again and hits him with her umbrella. This draws the attention of a police officer which forces Charles to take the child again. He walks down the road and ends up sitting on the side of the pavement. Shortly after he finds a small piece of paper in the clothes of the child which states that the child is an orphan and that he should be loved and taken care of. Charles ends up smiling and walks into the distance with the baby.

He then stops to light a cigar and notices a crying baby next to trash bin, first checking if someone is visible who might have thrown it in the trash from the windows like the trash that was thrown at him. He sees nothing, but then a woman with a baby stroller walks by and, assuming it must be hers, he places the baby he found in the stroller with the baby that is already in there. When the woman sees this, she gets angry at him and tells him to take the baby back, angrily walking away with her baby after he does so. After this, the man tries to place the baby back next to the bin where he found it but a policeman sees this and makes him take the baby back again. Following this incident, he sees an elderly man walking on a cane and tricks him into taking the baby, running away immediately when he does so. The elderly man also happens upon the stroller of the woman from earlier and also places the baby in it with the other baby, but again the woman sees this and gets angry, but at the younger man who placed it there earlier since he happens to be walking by at that moment. With the help of the policeman from before, she makes the younger man take the baby back again.

Afterwards he tries to get rid of the baby. He wants to leave the child in the alley, but is stopped by a police officer. His next attempt appears succesful at first. Chaplin hands the baby to an elderly man before quickly running away.  However, the elderly man proceeds to do exactly what Chaplin tried at first.

The main protagonist is shown walking along a small alley minding his own business, when a series of events unfolds. People are throwing garbage (?) out of their windows, while trying to aim for trash cans but missing them and almost hitting the main protagonist. Soon after that he pulls a box of cigarettes out of his jacket and starts to smoke. While he smokes he realises there is a baby lying on the street right next to him. Curiously he is looking for the parents or someone who might have dropped the baby there but cannot seem to find someone on the first look. However, when he turns around he spots a woman with a stroller and walks towards her. She disappears into a house and he puts the baby into the stroller, supposing she is the mother. The woman appears again and they start to argue, which implies she is not the mother. After almost taking her child, the protagonist picks up the child he found on the street. He then returns to the spot he found the baby in and is placing it there the way he stumbled upon it. When he turns around, there is a police officer standing in front of him, which leads to the protagonist promptly picking up the baby again, because of the implications.  He then walks away and as he passes another man, he pretends he needs to clean his shoes and signals the other man to hold the baby for a second, because he needs both hands in order to clean his footwear. As soon as the other man is holding the baby, the protagonis makes a run for it and hides somewhere in the previously shown alley. While looking for the protagonist, the second man comes across the same stroller shown before, getting the same idea as the protagonist and placing the baby in the woman's stroller. This time the woman does not realise that immediately as she is not present during this event. The moment she appears again and sees the second baby, the protagonist walks by her which leads her to running after him and hitting him with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby again. He then sits down on a pavement and contemplates dropping the baby in the sewer. He takes a closer look at the baby and inside the blankets covering the baby, there is a letter with the words ""Please love and care for this orphan child."". This immediately changes the protagonist's stance towards the child as he realises the parents are not around anymore to raise the baby and he feels responsible for it now and walks away as a newfound father."

Due to residents tossing their trash out of the window he almost gets hit by trash twice until eventually the third hit scores.  <br/> He looses his cigarette, takes out a new one and ignights it, ready to keep walking. <br/> But behind a barrel he finds a crying baby bundled up in rags. After looking around for someone close who might have placed the baby there, Chaplin picks it up and places it in the stroller of a mother passing by, claiming she 'dropped' the baby. The mother protests since there's already a baby in her stroller and the found one isn't hers. Chaplin hastily picks the baby up again and wants to put it back where he found it but a policeman spots him doing so, which caused Chaplin to pick the baby up again and walk out of the alley. <br/>  <br/> In passing he meets an old man with a crutch, pretends his shoelaces are undone and asks the man to hold the baby while he ties his shoelaces again. But the moment the old man focusses on the baby Chaplin runs off, hiding in the alley. <br/> The old man can't find Chaplin but spots the stroller from earlier in front of a shop in which he puts the baby before he walks off. <br/>  <br/> Eventually the mother comes back out of the shop and notices the foreign baby in her stroller. Coincidentally Chaplin passes by again and the mother thinks he put the baby in her stroller again. She runs after him, smacks him with her umbrella and drags him back to the stroller, fighting with him over the baby. Only when a policeman takes notice of the turmoil Chaplin hastily grabs the baby and rushes off. <br/>  <br/> They sit down on the sidewalk close to a drain. And for a moment Chaplin considers putting the baby in there but decides against it. He shrugs at the baby and takes a closer look at the rags covering it as he notices a piece of paper, asking the finder of the baby to take care of the orphan.  <br/>  <br/> In the end Chaplin takes the baby with him with a smile.

The trash smashes to the ground and Chaplin accelerates his steps but at the next corner, on the opposite side of the lane someone else is throwing down bricks.

He looks up and around as if to find the person who had dropped the baby out of the window. <br/> He sees a woman pushing a pram passing by. He runs after her and put the new found baby into her pram. The woman is getting very angry with Chaplin, so he takes the baby back and tries to return it to the place he had found it. In that moment a police officer watches him and Chaplin decides to pick the baby up again. Next he comes past another man and he pretends having to tie his shoe laces and meanwhile keeps the man holding the baby. Chaplin quickly runs away. The man goes away and puts the baby into the pram in front of a shop. <br/> Chaplin is now strolling along the pavement, past the pram. The woman, comes out of the shop, sees two babies in her pram and then sees Chaplin. She runs after him to beat him up with her umbrella. Chaplin takes the baby again. <br/> Exhausted and clueless he sits down on the pavement in front of a house, looking at the baby. He is surprised to find a paper under the cloth the baby is wrapped in. It reads ""love me and care for me"". This message instantly brings a big smile to his Chaplins face. He starts to hug the baby warmheartedly, gets up and leaves together with the baby in his arms, still caressing it."

A man in a suit with a cigar in his hand walks down an alley. Suddenly a huge amount of brickbrittles falls before him from above and he stumbles. He is now standing in a small segment of the street with garbage cans surrounding him. The camera zooms in for a close-up as he goes on to opening a metal cigar case and extracting a white cigar. He rids himself of his gloves and lights his cigar. His gaze wanders and he spotts a crying baby behind one of the bins.  He picks the baby up and looks around. A women with a baby stroller hurries through the background, leaves the stroller unattended while shopping. He then places the baby in the stroller, however she returns prematurely and interupts him. He tries to put the baby back in the corner, yet a police officer arrives and dissuedes him from proceeding. Cut. The same man with the baby apears in a different alley and hands the baby over to a strange old man, who has  an obvious walking issue and runs away. The man with the walking issue again places the baby in the stroller of the previous lady and dissapears into thin air. The cigar guy walks past and the woman goes after him as she assumes, he is the one responsiple for placing the baby in her stroller again. As they argue the police officer reappears on set and the cigar guy gives in and takes the baby with him. The cigar guy sits down next to a drain and considers his further actions. He even thiks about throwing the baby into the sewer system, but reevaluates that thought. Between the sheets of fabric in which the baby is wrapped up he finds a paper on which is written: Please care for this orphan child. The scene ends with him smiling and hugging the baby, before he leaves the shot.

An unseen person tosses trash out of the window, not minding the passersby underneath. When he eventually passes the window, he plays around with his walking stick before he is hit with more trash from another window. As it is a silent movie, the spoken text is shown in title cards, the first one says ""Awkward ass."" The man looks at the trash, the up towards the window and takes out a small box filled with cigars. To light one of them, he takes off his gloves and lights a match on the heel of his shoe. Then he throws his gloves away.  <br/> As he turns to the side, a baby is shown lying on the ground, seemingly abandoned. The man looks at the baby, then around as if he was searching for somebody responsible. When nobody is seen, he picks up the child. In the background, a woman appears from the left, pushing a stroller. The man attempts to get her attention and ends up following her to what seems to be her house. The stroller, which she left outside, is occupied by another child, older than the discovered baby, but the man wants to put the younger kid down nonetheless. When the woman re-appears, she is shocked, so the man tries to explain the situation by saying: ""Pardon me, you dropped something."" The woman does not seem to be happy about it and is shown yelling at the man, clearly indicating that this is not her child, so the man takes it with him once again. The woman storms off. <br/> Carrying the child back to the alley where he found it, the man wants to leave it there to be found by somebody else, but a police officers sees him doing it. When the man notices the officer, he promptly turns around once more, picks up the baby once more and leaves to the right side of the screen. <br/> A new alley is shown, with another man already walking along. The man walks up to him, stops, pretends that he has to tie his show laces and proceeds to hand him the child. He then runs off, leaving the baby to the stranger, but the new man follows. As the first man hides in a garage, the other one is looking for him, only to discover the stroller from before, still occupied by the other child. He puts the baby down, this time without the appearance of the mother. The man from the beginning, now child-less, dares to leave his hideout, only to run into the police man once more, so he quickly turns the other way. <br/> Meanwhile, the mother is shown, returning to her child where she finds the baby alongside it. However, as the man who actually placed it there has already left and the other man just happens to pass the stroller, she accuses him of leaving his child there. The accusation happens in the form of chasing him and hitting him with an umbrella, which causes the man to fall. She drags him back to the stroller, still hitting him as she does so. The police man comes out of an alley and notices the racket. The woman, still furious, explains the situation to him, which the man doesn't try to argue, so he only takes the baby and leaves the scene. As do the officer and the woman. <br/> In the next cut, the man standing on an empty sidewalk in front of a gutter. He sits down on the ground and opens said gutter. For a moment, he looks at the child, but then closes it again and only readjust his grip on the lump in his arms. for the first time, he looks at it more closely and discovers a small scrap of paper hidden in the folds of the blanket that is draped around the baby. ""Please love and care for this orphan child,"" is written on the paper. The man puts the paper away and looks at the baby again, smiling this time. In the last shot, he leaves to the end of the scenery."

He wears a suit, a hat and gloves. Due to getting hit by trash, the man lights up a cigarette. Next to a trash can he finds a newborn baby. After he realizes that there is no one near who the baby belongs to, he picks up the baby. When a woman with a baby stroller walks by, the man with the hat thinks that the baby belongs to her and then puts the into the stroller. The woman reacts angry and he takes the baby back. In a different street he passes by an elderly-looking man. He pretends that he has to lace his shoe and gives the baby in the arms of the elderly-looking man and runs away. The elderly-looking man is then hurrying behind him, but looses him in the courtyard. Due to the fact that he cannot find the man with the hat, he puts the baby in the stroller of the women, who has parked her stroller outside of a shop. She notices the baby in her stroller and coincidently meets the man with the hat whom she recognizes from before. After hitting him with an umbrella she tries to get him to take back the baby. When an officer is walking by, the man with the hat is giving up his defense and takes the baby back. He sits down at the sidewalk and takes a closer look at the baby. Inside the blanket he finds a letter, which says ""Please love and care for this orphaned baby"". The man with the hat gets up again and decides to take the baby with him."

Suddenly, after lighting a cigarette, Charlie finds a baby at the side of the road. After some confusion, he decides to put it in the pushchair of a women, assuming she 'dropped' the baby. But she didn't and makes him take it back. Charlie's next idea is to just put it back where he found it, but a policeman catches him in the act, which makes Charlie take it back into his arms and walk off. Fooling an old man, he then manages to leave the baby in said man's arms, hiding from him until he thinks it's safe to come out. The old man has the same idea as Charlie originally and drops the baby in the pushchair. Upon leaving his hiding spot, he encounters the policeman again This makes him change directions quickly. By chance, he walks past the women and her pushchair again, thus making her believe he dropped the baby in there and so she beats him with her umbrella. The policeman makes another appearance and Charlie is yet again forced to take back the baby. Dropping his cane on the sidewalk, he sits down on the curb to retrieve it. He is wondering for a moment whether he should drop the baby down the drain, but quickly decides against it. Instead, he finds a piece of paper with the words ""please love and care for this orphan child"" written on it. This seems to make him sentimental. He cuddles the child close to his chest and walks off."

He is startled and pauses to light a cigarette. He then finds a baby on the street that he tries to give to a women passing by with a buggy, assuming that it belongs to her. She seems to tell him that it’s not her child and Chaplin takes the baby back, trying to put it back where he found it. However, a police officer sees him and gives him a stern look which leads to Chaplin keeping the baby and quickly giving it to another man out of the officer’s sight. The man drops the baby into an unsupervised buggy which turns out to be the one belonging to the women we saw earlier. She sees Chaplin pass by, assumes that he put the baby there again and chases him with an umbrella, beating him with it. She and the officer then force Chaplin to take back the baby. Chaplin sits down at the side of the street with it and briefly seems to consider dropping it into a drain next to him. He then shrugs and finds a note attached to the blanket the baby is wrapped in that reads „please love and care for the orphan child“. Finally, he smiles at the baby and leaves, still holding it in his arms.

Charly continues walking towards the viewer, smoking a cigarette when another incident like this extinguishes his cigarette. He insults the person responsible as an awkward ass and then proceeds to look for a new cigarette in his cigar box. Once he finds one he taps it onto the lid and then puts it in his mouth while getting a match from the pocket of his vest that he lights at the bottom of his shoe and then tosses into the near garbage bin. After that he also tosses his gloves.  <br/> He looks around and sees an abandoned infant wrapped in blankets lying on the ground next to the garbage bins. He looks around as to find out if one of the people from the upper stories know anything about said child. As he picks it up a woman with a pram walks by in the background. Charly follows her and as she enters a building and leaves the pram with her own child unattended he places the infant in it and attempts to walk away. However, she reacts quite furiously and tells him to take out the baby and then proceeds to walk off in the other direction.  <br/> Charly though places the infant back on the ground where he first found him only to realize that there is a police officer standing right behind him. He then quickly picks up the baby again and walks away. He meets another man and pretends to have stepped into something. He hands over the baby to said man in order to clean off his shoe but then quickly runs back the way he came, leavin the baby with the other man.  <br/> Charly hides in a shed and the other man while looking for him sees the lady's pram and puts the baby in it. When leaving his hiding spot Charly again encounters the police officer which makes him change direction. He walks past the pram and the woman who again recognizes him and runs after him, hitting him with her umbrella. They walk back to the pram just as the police officer walks past. She continues to tell the officer about the child that clearly isn't hers and Charly ends up taking the child and walking off. He sits down onto the curb of the road and opens the gully as if thinking about putting the baby in there. Instead of doing so he finds a letter hidden between the baby's blankets that reads ""please love and care for this orphan child"". He puts the letter into his pocket, hugs the child tighter, laughs at him and then walks away with the baby in his arms."

He takes out his walking stick and bends it a few times in his hands. While he is momentarily distracted, he gets hit by something that was being thrown out of a window, which causes him to drop his cigar. He then proceeds to take out his box of cigars and, after taking off his gloves, lightens another one with the sole of his shoe. After that he throws his gloves in a trash can. That is when he spots an abandoned baby lying behind another trash can. He picks it up and looks around to see who it might belong to and spots a woman with a pram. He hurries over to her and puts the baby in her pram. She gets angry and makes him understand that it isn't hers. He takes the baby out of the pram again and she scuttles away. He walks back to where he found the baby and puts it back down behind the trash can. However, when he realises that a police officer saw him doing so, he picks it back up and hurries away. Then he walks past an elderly man with a walking stick and tricks him into holding the baby while he pretends to tie his shoelaces and runs away. The elderly man hurries after him but can't find him. Instead, he sees a pram with another baby already in it, proceeds to put the baby in it, too, and walks away unnoticed. It turns out, the pram belongs to the woman from earlier, who recognises the baby. By chance, the protagonist walks past her in that moment, not noticing her or the baby. She runs after him and proceeds to beat him with her umbrella while dragging him back to the pram in order for him to take the baby back. The commotion attracts the police officer from earlier causing him to take the baby back and hurry away. Resigned, he sits down on the kerbside and holds the baby in his arm. That is when he finds a note in its blanket which reads ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". He looks at the baby, smiles at it, holds it closer and walks away."

He gets hit by trash falling down from a window above, which makes him lose his cigarette. Thus, he gets a new cigarette out of a metal tin from his pocket. Suddenly, he finds a crying baby on the dirty floor, bundled up in blankets. He looks around, wondering where it came from. He then picks it up and sees a lady with a baby carriage with another baby in it, walking by. Charlie assumes that the baby is probably hers, approaches her and puts the found baby in the baby carriage. The Lady seems outraged and they start arguing. Apparently it is not her baby so Charlie takes it out of the baby carriage, the lady leaves and he puts it back on the floor where he found it. But then a police officer comes walking by, so Charlie is forced to pick the baby back up. He walks around a corner where he sees an older man with a walking stick. Charlie hands him the baby, quickly runs away and hides in a garage. The older man finds the parked baby carriage from the lady from before, who seems to be in a store at that time, and like Charlie before he puts the baby into the carriage and walks away. Charlie comes out of his hideout and walks down the street where the lady comes out of the store. She sees the strange baby in her baby carriage and sees Charlie walking by. She gets very upset, runs after him and beats him with an umbrella, dragging him back to the baby carriage. They start discussing once more, the police officer comes by and as the lady starts to explain the situation, Charlie gives in and once againg takes the baby with him. Not knowing what else to do, he sits down on the sidewalk and for a second he considers putting the baby into the sewer. He then takes a closer look at the baby and, getting a papercut on his finger, he finds a note between the baby's blankets.

After being hit by rubble twice and lighting a cigarette, he discovers a baby on the ground, wrapped in a blanket. Visibly puzzled, the man gazes around, trying to find out who the baby might belong to. He then picks it up and notices a woman pushing a stroller passing by. He places the baby into the stroller across from another baby, but takes it back after the woman gets mad at him. The man then decides to put the baby back on the ground where he found it, but changes his mind when he encounters a police officer. The man notices an old man with a walking cane and tricks him into holding the baby, whereupon the first man runs off. The old man puts the baby in the same stroller as the previous man and walks away. When the first man walks by the stroller, he gets beaten by the woman and gives in, taking back the baby. Finally, he sits down on the curb, discovers a note hidden in the baby's blanket saying that it is an orphan child. This causes the man to lovingly engage with the child and walk away.

Because he is scared that the baby is going to get hit by rubble that previously fell down on him, too, he picks it up, but does not really seem to know what to do with it. He then sees a woman with a pram and tries to put the child in there. The mother, however, of course notices that this is not her child and makes him take it out again, so Chaplin tries to lay it back down to where he found it, but is caught by a police officer, so he picks it up again. After running around trying to find somewhere to put the baby, he gives it to another man and quickly runs away. That man puts it in the woman's pram again and flees, too. When Chaplin walks past the woman after he was hiding somewhere, she thinks that it was him putting the baby back in there again and hits him with her umbrella until he takes the baby back. After Chaplin even debates leaving it in the drain, he finds a note on the child that states that this child is an orphan, and asks the finder to take care of it and love it. This is where he finally comes to terms with his fate and starts taking care of the baby.

He picks up the crying baby and tries to sneak it into a pram a mother left on the street while running errands. The mother notices and gets angry at Chaplin, who then has to take the baby back. He then tried to lay it back where he found it, but a police man catches him, so Chaplin has to take the baby again. He sees an old man and asks him to hold the baby so Chaplin can tie his shoes. The old man takes the baby and Chaplin runs away. Since the old man is not fast enough to catch him, he lays the baby into the first pram he can find, which is coincidentally the same pram in which Chaplin already has put the baby.  The angry mother thought Chaplin was at fault, found him and handed the baby back. Chaplin sits down on a curb and does not know what he should do with this baby. He even had a quick thought about dumping it in the sewage. Finally Chaplin starts searching in the cloth and blankets the baby is swaddled in and finds a note. The note says „ please love and care for this orphan child“. Now he starts to smile and hold the baby close, accepting his fate.

He walks und windows and is hit by debris that is thrown out the windows twice. He pauses in search of a box that contains cigar and cigarette butts. He lights one. He then realizes a baby is laying on the floor to his left behind a dustbin. He picks it up. It seems like he feels compelled to do so out of empathy. Still, feeling overwelmed he tries to get rid of the baby by placing it in a pram that a mother left unattended.  The mother realizes the attempt to rid himself of the baby and rejects it. After a little back and forth he ends up sitting on the curb with the baby in his arms. He finds a little note that is tucked under the cloth the baby is wrapped in. The note is asking for him to take care of the baby as it is an orphan. He then seems to accept the baby.

He walks past the bricks and is hit by some trash that fell from outside the shot. The line “Awkward ass” appears on a black screen. Chaplin takes out a new cigarette, takes of his gloves, ignites a match with his foot and lights the cigarette. He then throws his gloves in a bin. The next shot shows a crying baby on the floor. He takes a closer look at it and tries to find out where it might have come from by looking up. Chaplin takes up the child. In this moment a woman is walking by in background with a stroller. He walks to her and puts the baby down. The screen says “Pardon me, you dropped something”. The woman starts yelling at the man and he first attempts to take her child away, then his own. The woman furiously walks away. Chaplin then tries to lay the child back on the ground where it came from but a police officer is watching, so he decides to take it with him again. Next Chaplin encounters an old man. He acts like he has to tie his shoelaces and hands the child over to the old man. As soon as he is holding the baby Chaplin runs away. The old man follows him and finds the lady’s stroller. He puts the infant down and walks away. Then the woman returns to her child, only to find the other kid sitting in her stroller again. She sees Chaplin walking by and starts hitting him with her umbrella. She drags him back to the stroller and they argue about the situation. When the police officer returns Chaplin quickly decides to take the child away again. The next scene shows Chaplin and the child alone. They sit down on the street and Chaplin takes a look at the gutter next to him. He decides not to put the child down there and starts playing with it. He suddenly finds a note which he unfolds. It reads: Please love and care for this orphan child. Chaplin smiles at the baby while deciding to keep it. The last shot shows his feet walking away.

He takes a cigarette out of a small tin and lightens it with the help of a match and the sole of his shoe. He then bins his dirty gloves, looks around and finds a crying baby, wrapped in rugs, lying on the ground. He picks the baby up and looks around to see where the baby might have came from. He then sees a woman passing by with a baby carriage with another child in it. As he thinks she has lost the baby he has found he puts the baby into the baby carriage as well. This makes the woman very angry with him, as it is apparently not her child, so the man takes it out again and lies it back to where he has found it. When he turns around, though, a policeman is watching him, so again he picks up the child and walks away. Around the next corner he sees an old man whom he gives the child, deliberately only to do up his laces, but actually he is trying to get rid of the baby and runs away. The old man tries to follow him but cannot find him. Instead he comes by the baby carriage from earlier and, as the mother has left it unattended for a moment, puts the abandoned baby in it and runs away. When the woman comes back to the baby carriage and finds the second baby in it again, she looks around the street and sees the first man (coincidently) walking by. She runs after him, hits on him with her umbrella and drags him back to the baby carriage, where they argue. This is when the policeman comes to see what has happened, so the man takes the baby again and walks away with it. He sits down with the baby on the street, shortly thinking about getting rid of it in the canalisation, but deciding against it. As he looks at the baby alittle closer he finds a note hidden inside the baby's rugs saying ""Please love and care for this orphan child. Having pity with the baby, he smiles at it and takes it home with him."

He puts the baby in the carriage and says to her ""You dropped something"". But she insists that it is not her baby, and demands that he takes it back. After reluctantly taking it back, he decides to put the baby where he found it. After realizing that he is being watched by a policeman, he walks off with the baby and crams it into the arms of an elderly man. This man puts the baby into the woman's baby carriage again. When she realizes the strange baby is back in her carriage, she beats up Charlie Chaplin, who was just walking past her at that moment. The policeman reappears, and the woman demands that Charlie Chaplin takes the baby back. After doing so, he  walks through the alleys and ultimately sits down on the pavement.

As he is looking around himself, he takes a small metal box out of his coat and lights a cigarette. He throws away his gloves and looking down on the ground, he sees a baby that is crying and all wrapped up in a blanket. Chaplin once again looks around as if the child fell from heaven (or even out of the window like the trash earlier) and finally picks it up. He doesn't know what to do with the kid so as he sees a lady with a pram, he thinks it may be her child and puts the baby back in the buggy. The lady seems to be upset and tells him to take the baby back, which he eventually does. Chaplin decides to put the baby back where he found it and an officer appears which leads him to pick the baby up again. As he walks past an old man, he shows him that he has to tie his shoe laces and asks the man to hold his baby and puts it in his arms. Chaplin pretends to tie his laces but runs off and the old man follows him. Chaplin hides and as the man doesn't find him anymore, he puts the baby in the pram of the woman we saw earlier. Chaplin walks past her and she follows him and hits her with an umbrella. She then wants him to take the baby back which he eventually does once the officer is back as well. He leaves and sits down with the baby in his lap. Chaplin seems to think about just putting the child in the sewer but realizes that he can't do it. He then takes a closer look and finds a piece of paper inside the blanket which states that the child is an orphan. Chaplin smiles at the baby and leaves with him.

Charles Chaplin takes a walk through the dirty back alleys of a city. After lighting a cigarette for himself, he encounters a crying baby hidden behind trash cans. He picks it up and, while looking around for the mother, sees a woman passing by with a stroller. He follows the woman, thinking it might be the baby's mother. But the baby does not appear to belong to the woman, as she starts to complain and argue after Charles put the baby in the stroller, next to another infant. He then proceeds to pick up the baby again, only to be followed by a police officer who observes Charles putting the baby back on the ground by the trash cans where he initially found it. After receiving a stern look from the police officer, Charles picks up the baby again and turns to leave. He next tries to hand the baby over to a random stranger by pretending to tie his shoes while the man holds the baby. But when he runs off, he is followed by the other man. The baby ends up again in the stroller of the same woman as before. Meanwhile, Charles walks into the police officer again who appears to find it suspicious that Charles is no longer carrying a baby.

After narrowly avoiding being covered in garbage thrown out of windows, and after lighting a cigarrette, Chaplin finds an orphaned baby lying next to a garbage can. He picks it up and decides to return it. A mother walks by, pushing her own baby in a baby carriage. Chaplin slips the orphan into the carriage next to the other baby, but the mother notices and protests until Chaplin takes back the orphan. Discouraged, Chaplin plans to place the baby back next to the garbage can where he found it. A stern-looking police officer observes him, which causes Chaplin to change his mind and keep walking with the baby. Around the corner, he sees another passer-by and hands him the orphan. Chaplin runs off and hides, and the confused passer-by, seeking to get rid of the orphan as well, places the baby in the mother's baby carriage. Chaplin, who is now convinced that the matter is resolved, happens to walk by the baby carriage, and the mother suspects him of having slipped the orphan into her carriage a second time. The police officer joins the altercation, and the mother protests to the officer, so that poor Chaplin is forced to take back the orphan yet again. Exhausted, Chaplin sits down on the curb with the orphan in his arm. He finds a note which asks the person who finds the orphan to take loving care of the baby. Chaplin smiles affectionately and appears to accept that responsibility. He stands up, with the baby still in his arms, and walks off scene."

Laying there he finds a baby, wrapped in sheets with a scarf around their head. He picks it up and while looking at the baby a woman with a stroller walks past towards one of the entrances in the back of the alley. When Chaplin sees her, he tries giving back the baby, assuming she dropped it by accident. She demands him to take it out of the stroller, where he previously placed it. Chaplin does so, and brings the baby back to where he found it next to the bins. A police-officer observes the action and when Chaplin notices the officer, he quickly picks the baby off of the ground and into in his arms again and walks back through the alley, where he came from in the beginning. Around the corner a man is walking and Chaplin approaches him, gets him to hold the baby under the pretence of tying his shoelace and while the man is engrossed in looking at the baby, Chaplin flees back around the corner, abandoning child and man. The now confused man brings the baby to what I assume to be a shop, where he sees a child inside a stroller and places the baby inside it as well, before running away as Chaplin did before. A woman exits the doorway and sees the two children in the stroller, one of which is only hers, obviously. Just as she does, Chaplin walks past, she hurries after him, yelling at him while catching up. It is the same woman, that he already tried to give the child to before in the alley. She hits him multiple times with her umbrella and drags him back to the stroller, having him take the baby out again. He refuses, but when the same officer comes back and the woman tries to engage him in the argument, Chaplin takes the baby and leaves. He sits down on the curb with the child in his arms and contemplates dropping it in the sewer for a second. But he decides agains it. He takes away the sheets from the child’s neck and notices a piece of paper on which is written a plea to take care of the child, which apparently is orphaned. Taking another look at the child, Chaplin picks up his cane, holding the child and walks with it back through the alley he first came through.

He tries to get rid of the baby by putting it into a baby carriage of a woman passing by. The lady is furious with him and he takes the baby and tries to put it back, where he found it, but a policeman who happened to pass by, watches him and he is obligated to pick the baby back up. Next Chaplin tries to dispose of the child by pretending to have to tie his shoelace, putting the baby into the arms of a passerby, and taking off quickly. The stranger who is now stranded with the baby encounters the same baby carriage, as Chaplin has before and puts the child in there. Meanwhile, Chaplin steps out of a shed he had hid in and almost runs into the same policeman again, so he takes off as fast as he can. Suddenly, the woman, who had parked the baby carriage in front of a store, steps out and sees Chaplin walking by, presuming he tried to get rid of the baby again by putting it into her baby carriage. Furiously, she runs after him, beating him with an umbrella. At the same time, the policeman is coming around the corner and also starts berating Chaplin, who again picks up the child and walks on. Exhausted he sits down on the curb and contemplates sticking the baby into the street drain. But as he looked closer at the baby, he finds a note asking to "" love and care for this orphan child.""

Picking the apparently abandoned baby up, Chaplin is trying to figure out what to do when he sees a lady with a stroller passing by. Assuming that she is the mother of the child, he runs after her and, when she turns around, places the baby in the stroller. However, the lady notices and in a displeased manner makes Chaplin understand that the baby is not, in fact, hers, as her own baby is already sitting in the stroller. He is therefore obliged to take the child back. Deciding to bring it back to where he found it, he is caught by a policeman right when he tries to put the baby down next to the trash can. Next, he hands it over to another man while pretending to have to fix his shoe and then runs off. The other man chases after him, yet cannot find him and decides to place the baby in the very same stroller Chaplin had put it in before and which is now standing in front of a shop entrance. The lady, leaving the shop and seeing two babies in her stroller, recognizes Chaplin as he walks by (by accident) and the two enter into a heated discussion. In the middle of their argument, the police officer that Chaplin had encountered before walks by and joins them. Chaplin is, therefore, once again, forced to take the baby with him. He sits down on the boardwalk next to a gully top and takes off the top, obviously contemplating to drop the baby in there. On lifting the child up, he discovers a piece of paper, reading ""please love and care for this orphan child"". He looks at the baby again, his facial expression changing, and apparently has a change of heart: smiling at the child, he lifts it up and walks away holding it in his arms."

While he wonders where it came from, a mother is passing and he puts the child into her pram, thinking that it must be hers. Since he is mistaken she starts protesting and thus Chaplin attempts to return the baby to where he found it. However, he is caught by a police officer and is forced to pick the baby up again. Then he tries to trick a passer-by into holding the baby and runs into hiding. The man follows him but can only find the woman's pram where he leaves the baby. Chaplin comes out of hiding and walks away but the woman, who has already noticed the baby in her pram, sees him and starts beating him with her umbrella. Again, the police officer arrives and Chaplin has to run off with the baby. In another street, he drops his cane and has to sit down to pick it up. For a moment he considers dropping it into the sewers but then takes a closer look at the child. He finds a note that asks the finder to care for the child since it is an orphan. In the end, Chaplin gets up again and decides to take the baby with him.

Just as he attempts to light a cigar, he sees a baby wrapped up in a blanket, lying on the ground next to a metal container.  <br/> He picks the baby up and attempts to find out where it came from and how it got there.

He puts it into the pram, but the woman insists that the baby is not hers. <br/> Chaplin then takes the child back and goes to put it back down where he found it. However, he is interrupted by a police officer patrolling in the neighbourhood, so he quickly picks the baby back up and leaves. <br/> Just as he rounds the corner he sees an elderly man and gives the baby to him, pretending to tie his shoelaces before running the other way. The elderly man attempts to run after him, but instead spots the same pram Chaplin put the baby into before. The man repeats Chaplin's previous action and leaves as well. <br/> In that moment, the protagonist comes out of hiding and happens to pass that same pram. The woman Chaplin met earlier spots him and beats him with an umbrella, thinking that it was him who put the baby back. They argue and as the same police officer form earlier joins them Chaplin takes the child out of the pram. <br/> Defeated, he sits down on the pavement. As he touches the baby's blanket he feels the hard edge of a note and takes it out. It says: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".

Just as he is about to walk through a narrow alley more rubbish is thrown out of a window above him which just so happens to hit him as he walks by. He stops and just as he lights himself a cigar he sees a crying baby laying next to a rubbish can. Chaplin picks up the baby and spots a woman with a pram. While the woman disappears he puts the baby into the pram. However, the woman quickly returns and angrily tells him to take back the baby as it is not hers. In the process of following her request, Chaplin almost picks up the wrong baby. After the encounter with the woman he attempts to put the baby back where he found it but is spotted by a policeman and quickly picks the child back up. Being back where he started Chaplin walks along the road with the baby in his arms when he spots an elderly gentleman. He hands him the baby, pretending to have to tie his shoelaces and runs away. The elderly man follows Chaplin but is unable to find him, as he hides in a doorway. As Chaplin before, the man spots a pram and puts the baby in it before walking away. The woman from his earlier encounter approaches the pram, spots the baby before seeing Chaplin walk by and begins beating him with an umbrella dragging him back to the pram. The policeman appears again and Chaplin quickly picks up the baby again and leaves. He sits down with the baby on the pavement, contemplating for a moment whether to drop it into a drain. After discarding the thought he finds a note on the baby asking him to ""please love and care for this orphan child"". Chaplin's heart visibly softens. He smiles at the baby and, after wrapping his arms around it tightly, gets up and walks away with the baby."

He dodges some garbage being thrown out of a window but shortly after entering an alley way he is hit by another load of what looks like food scraps. It looks like in the process he lost his cigarette and so he takes another out of a metal box containing cigarettes and cigars. After taking off his gloves he lights a match by scraping it across the sole of his shoe, lights his cigarette and then throws both the match and his gloves away. Shortly after, the man notices a baby on the ground next to some garbage cans and, after apparently looking around in the air for the origin of the baby picks it up. In the background a woman pushing a pram can be seen walking by. The man turns around and while the woman isn't looking deposits the baby next to the woman's baby that is already inside the pram. The woman returns and the man tells her that she dropped something. She is not impressed by this and demands that he take the baby away again. After first trying to take the wrong baby, the man takes the correct baby to the place where he found it. Turning around, he comes face to face with a police officer and immediately turns around to pick the baby back up again and walks away with it in his arms. Next, he tries to give the baby to an older man walking down a street with a cane by pretending that he has to tie his shoe and after the older man has the baby in his arms he runs away and hides. The older man follows him and comes across the pram of the same women seen earlier. He deposits the baby into the pram and walks away. The man comes out from his hiding place and walks past the woman and her pram again, who has discovered that the same baby has been pushed onto her again. She sees the man walk past and beats him up with her umbrella, dragging him back to the baby by the scruff of his neck and demanding that he take it back. The police officer can be seen approaching and the woman seems to accuse the man, who takes the baby back and sits down on a curb with it. He seems to contemplate putting the baby inside of a street drain, but decides against it. After searching the babies clothes he finds a note saying ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". The man smiles at the baby and walks away with it in his arms."

As he moves towards the camera, more garbage is dropped from a different window and hits Chaplin on the head. He dusts off his jacket and continues on his way. He stops to retrieve a cigarette butt from a tin in his pocket, takes off his gloves, lights the cigarette, and throws his gloves away. Next to the garbage can, he discovers a baby wrapped in a blanket. He looks up and around, and picks it up. When a woman with a stroller walks by, he quickly follows her to return the lost baby to her. She stops and he places the baby inside her stroller. The baby does not seem to belong to the woman and she gets upset. She sends Chaplin away and he returns to the same spot where the baby was found. When he is about to put it back on the ground, a police officer suddenly appears behind him. Chaplin picks the baby back up and leaves the scene. He stops an old man on the street, asks him to hold the baby, and runs off. The old man tries to follow him but Chaplin is faster and manages to hide. The old man discovers the same stroller from earlier parked outside a shop and places the baby inside it. As the woman comes out of the shop and discovers the strange baby in her stroller, Chaplin walks by and she runs after him. She takes her umbrella, knocks him to the ground, and drags him back to her stroller. The two of them begin to argue and are joined by the police officer. Chaplin takes back the baby and leaves. He sits down on the curb, next to a sewer grate, and opens it, looking at the baby as though he is considering to drop it into the sewer. He quickly changes is mind and closes the grate again. Inside the blanket, in which the baby is wrapped up, Chaplin discovers a handwritten letter. It reads, ""Please love and care for this orphan child."" Realizing that the baby is not lost, he seems to make the decision to keep it. He smiles, gets up, and leaves."

The baby was covered inside some cloths and Chaplin didn't know about to do about him. Then, he saw a mother with his child far away, and he wondered that maybe she was also the mother of the child he found, so he gave the child to the woman saying that it was hers. <br/> The woman refused to take care of that baybe since it wasn't hers, so she shouted to Chaplin telling him not to bother her anymore, so Chaplin decided to place the child right where he found him. As he was doing that, a police man who was patrolling around the area stared at Chaplin with a serious look, so Chaplin wasn't able to leave the child where he found him. <br/> Therefore, he started walking around far away from the police man, trying to look for somebody that could take care of that little baby, and then he found another old man around there that could be his perfect target. Chaplin asked the old man If he could take care of the baby for a second, and the right moment he gave him the little boy he started to run away as fast as he could. <br/> However, the old man managed to get rid off the little baby by leaving him in the baby  cart of the mother previously mentioned, and then he also run away. When the mother found that child once again in her baby cart, she thought that it was Chaplin who did that, so as soon as she saw him again she started to beat him with her lady bag with no mercy. Moreover, the police man appeared once again in the scenario while the woman was complaining about Chaplin, so finally Chaplin had to admit his lose and take care of the child. <br/> At the end of the video, we can see how Chaplin thought for a moment to throw the little child into the sewer, but then he regreted it. Then, he took a loot at the baby's cloths and he found a little paper that had the following message written down: ""Take care of this precious child"", and then he decided to take care of him and he suddenly was happy again."

I get a lot of feelings about the video, first because of the action that the main actor takes with the subject, and even more with the circumstances that come before him, but he decides to pick it up and hand it to somebody so that I care because I think that in his mind was that he could not have it for x and circumstance that will happen not knowing that in the end he would touch staying with him because they watched him not letting go of what he found; Nevertheless this makes much presence in our lives in occasions that finds people without waiting them that in the end one wants to remove them completely of our lives but that with actions that are incorporated within the moment does not let us let go until accepting the reality that is Is living.

Chaplin in his films denounced several injustices that existed at that time. His movies aside from spending a good time laughing, they have several subliminal messages about what society is like. <br/> In my opinion Chaplin is the best  comedic actor in the silenc film.

People are throwing rubbish out of their windows, and Mr. Chaplin gets hit twice by the falling rubbish. All of a sudden, he realises that there is something more than rubbish laying on the floor; there is an abandoned child. Confused, Mr. Chaplin, looks around to see if he can find the child's parents. When a lady who is carrying a pushchair  passes by, he assumes that the lady had lost or abandoned the child. When he hands the baby over to the lady, the lady reacts furiously, as the baby is not hers.  <br/>  <br/> Disappointed, Mr. Chaplin decices to leave the baby back where it was, when he walks into a police officer, who stares at him when he sees Mr. Chaplin leaving a baby on the streets. Having changed his mind due to the presence of the angry-looking officer, he hands the baby to an anonymous man who he sees in a nearby street. The anonymous man then sees the lady with the pushchair and decides to leave the baby in it and run away. However, when the lady sees Mr. Chaplin again, she hands the baby back to him.  <br/>  <br/> This humorous short clip ends on a good note, as Mr. Chaplin reads a note that explains that the baby is an orphan needy of care and love, and decides to take care of him.

She gets really angry with Chaplin and doesn't accept the baby so Chaplin decides to bring the baby back to the place where he found him. When he finally gets rid of the baby he finds out that there's a policeman right behind him, so he has to take the baby again and bring it with him. This time he tries to cheat a man by giving him the baby so he can tie his shoelaces and when the man is not looking he starts running. The man started chasing Chaplin to give him his baby back but he couldn't reach him so, this man decides to give the baby to the same woman but this time he left him on the baby cart while she was not paying attention. Then, Chaplin casually went through that same street because he was being chased by the policeman since he didn't have the baby with him, so when this woman saw Chaplin, she started to kick him with an umbrella and Chapin finally took the baby with him since he didn't have another choice. Then, he sat on the sidewalk and saw that the baby had a note with him asking for love and care because he was an orphan so Chaplin finally decided to take the baby with him.

For example, he tries to give him to a woman that has a cart in which there's already a baby or to a vagabond who is having a walk quietly. It is also interesting the fact that he meets a policeman everytime he gives the child to someone and the policeman thinks the baby is from Chaplin and that he wants to leave him. Despite all the attempts, the baby in one way or another returns to Chaplin's arms and he finds a note that was in the baby's clothes. The note explains that the people that has left the child wants him to be treated with love. This note convinces Chaplin and he decides to take care of him.

This video tells the story of a man that was walking in the street and suddenly arrives to a closed street with some rubbish. In the scene we can discover the cheerful way of living of this man. He does things that ordinary people wouldn't do. For instance, to a light a cigarette with a shoe. While he's smoking this cigarette, he finds a kid abandoned. He doesn't know what to do and he starts looking everywhere to guess who is the mother but he doesn't find an answer. The only thing he knows is that he doesn't want to take care of him; so he tries to find a person to do it but he doesn't have success. He even tries to leave him where he found him, but a policeman sees him doing it, so he doesn't have any other option and keeps on looking for a person to take care of him. At the end of the scene, he realizes that he wouldn't find a person and he decides to take care of him. What made him make a decision is a letter that he finds with a child. After reading it, he realizes that he was the perfect person he was looking for."

Before that, he decides to leave the baby in the same place where he found him, but a policeman appears and he takes again the baby. In his escape, he sees a man and, discreetly, asks him to take the baby for a moment. In this moment, he decides to run but the man realizes it. Chaplin achieves to  hide in a hallway and the man finds the mother who was found by Chaplin later. The man decides to drop the baby in the wagon because the mother was not there. On the other hand, Chaplin ,after going out of his hiding place, sees the policeman again, but this time without the baby. He pretends and manages to avoid him. The woman realizes the new baby in her wagon and, in the same moment, Chaplin appears walking. She follows him and hits him with her umbrella. Again, she asks him to take the baby and he plays dumb. The policeman appears and the woman tells him what has happened, and Chaplin ends up by taking again the baby. Chaplin, without knowing what to do, sits down in a kerb and sees a sewer. After thinking to leave the baby there, he does not leave him there and decide to see if there is something inside the blanket that covers him. He sees a note that says that this child is orphaned and that pleasetake care of him. After reading this, Chaplin looks shocked at the baby and decides to be in charge of him."

Firstly he passed through a drop of work material as it could be cement. Secondly he founded a baby that at first he thought someone must have lost him so he keep on trying to give it to someone else in order to feel free again with any responsability or blame but then he realised that the baby was and an orphan and something on his inside changed. Finally he decided to keep it. To conclude we can highlight the fact that how quick can change our lifes without even noticing about it.

The man takes the baby and he tries to give it to a woman when she is not aware of it. He lets the baby inside the woman's baby carriage, but the woman notices it so she gives the baby back to the man because she doesn't want it. He sees a policeman that is taking a walk so he conceals. Then, he sees a man and he asks for him to hold the baby while he ties up his shoes and suddenly he (Chaplin) runs out so the man stays with the baby. The man makes the same tactic about the woman's baby carriage that Chaplin did before and he gets to scape from keeping the baby. Chaplin passes next to that woman who has seen already the baby and she starts to follow him to give him back the baby, and finally she reaches him. Chaplin doesn't know what to do anymore so he sits down on the ground with the baby on his arms and suddenly he sees a note that the baby has inside his clothes and it says that the person who found that orphan baby took care of him and loved him, so Chaplin heeds it and stays with the baby at the end.

He took the baby and looked for someone to take care of, so he saw a woman with another baby and tried to deliver him to her, although that woman wasn't his mom so she didn't accept the kid. <br/> In fact, the woman hit him on the back because she thought he was kidnapping her baby. <br/> He took off the baby and went to the corner where he found the baby and came to left him there, but a policeman watched him and he had to runaway with the baby. Some meters after that, another man walking on the street and Chaplin didn't lose the chance, he tried to give this man the problem..and the real problem came now, whe this new man tried to deliver the baby to the same woman as Chaplin tried before.

Walking through a place where there is garbage, he picks up another cigarette and while smoking it, he finds a baby on the ground abandoned. He decides to pick it up and at that moment he finds a woman with a stroller for two babies. Seeing that this woman only had one baby in the cart, he places it in the other part of it, thinking that it would belong to the woman. The woman returns the baby to him because it was not hers. Not finding his parents, he places him where he was but at that moment, a policeman appears so he must pick up the baby again so as not to be scolded by the agent. Walking down the street, he gives the baby to a man who passes by. The man, not wanting the baby, casually places the baby in the stroller of the woman who appeared earlier. When the woman realized that the baby was back in the stroller, she blames Chaplin. In addition, the policeman appears, so Chaplin keeps the baby. At the end we see how the baby carried a note that said take care of him. Chaplin decides to stay with him permanently.

He is cunningly treating a really serious and tragic topic through a humoristic sketch. At Chaplin's time, many orphans were abandoned on the streets or in front of orphanage because their, normally, single mothers were unable to give them the life they deserve. In other cases, they abandoned them because they were not supposed to have children or those children were the result of a rape and that fact had to be hidden no matter what it cost. Some of the kids died and many others stayed their whole life in a place where they were not happy nor well-treated. Fortunately, several children had the chance of a brand new life when people like our protagonist decided to take care of those little and vulnerable souls.

By lighting a cigarette, he then discovers an abandoned baby on the ground, worried and after seeing a mum going for a walk with her baby, he thinks she had dropped the baby. Quickly and convinced that the baby belongs to her, he takes the baby to the lady. Nevertheless, the lady gets mad, rejecting the fact of being her baby. With him among is hands again, Chaplin tries to put him back where he had found him but, just before doing so, a police officer crosses by, scaring him from abandoning the child.

The first one seems to be well dressed, although it is contradictory at the moment in which a cigarette case appears and he appropriates it. He is in an alley where he is struck by debris. After this, a baby is found lying on the street with no one around. At this point, the protagonist does not know very well what to do and desperately he tries to get rid of him but he can’t achieve it. Suddenly he stumbles over the police and picks up the baby again. However, he continues in the attempt to get rid of the baby by leaving him to another man who appears in the street. The man returns the baby to a baby car and the owner of it returns him to Charles Chaplin again. It seems as if it was fate, trying to give the protagonist somebody to stay with, to stop that feeling of loneliness that he may have. He is still thinking of somewhere to leave the baby but he seems to be worried in turn and he seems to be accepting the reality. Then, he finds a note inside the baby's clothes in which someone asks the one who finds the baby to love and care for him, because he is orphaned. Suddenly, the man seems to feel sorry and at the same time content. Finally, he begins to make the baby smile and leaves with him. The video presents a tone of tragedy where there is fear and pity but at the end there is a sense of happiness and hope for that baby.

Chaplin thinks that the baby is hers or that maybe she could take care of him. However, when Chaplin puts the baby in the trolley, the woman shouts at him as the baby is not hers. Because of that, Chaplin decides to put the baby again on the place where he found him but, a police officer warns Chaplin that he cannot abandone a baby, as if he or she was his own child. Chaplin takes the baby again on his arms and starts walking on the street. He sees another man and Chaplin gives the baby to him. This aforementioned man sees the trolley of the prior woman again.

Later, Chaplin tries to return the baby to where he found him, however, as a policeman is watching him, he has to take the kid again with him. Then, Chaplin attempts to leave the child with an old man by faking that he has to tie his shoes and running afterwards. Nevertheless, the old man leaves the child on a baby buggy he founds, which is that from the woman that appeared on the previous scene. When she notices the new baby and identifies Chaplin on the street, she attacks him with her umbrella and makes him take the unknown child with him again. Meanwhile, the policeman observes them. Later, he thinks about leaving the child in a sewer, but refuses the idea and, when he does, he finds a letter inside the baby clothes and discovers that it is an orphan kid.

Chaplin, who is under it, goes away from. With his typical way of walking, he starts to smoke. As he goes into the nearest part of the scene to us: he makes sure that his walking stick is flexible enough, he recolocates his hat when suddenly some rubbish falls from the sky so he gets dirty. He swears. <br/>  <br/>  When he arrives to that part of the scene, he looks at the rubbish bin and also finds out that he only has one cigarette left, which he puts in his mouth. He puts off his gloves and starts a fire with the sole and the match in order to turn on the cigarette. He throws away the match and, as he doesn’t know where he can put his gloves, he throws them to the bin. He shakes his hands and as his is smoking he discovers a baby wrapped in a blanket. He cannot really believe it. He looks up several as he was trying to find out how did the baby had got in there. He looks again to the baby and he takes it as a woman with a stroller is passing by just right behind him. <br/>  <br/>  He looks up again and is when he looks down again when he realises that there is a  woman that has just left the stroller in the street while she has got into a shop. The baby might be hers. He tries to call her attention but as it wasn’t successful he goes to the stroller (where there is another baby) and puts the unknown baby inside. <br/> When the woman comes out she finds out that a stranger (Chaplin) is putting a baby into her stroller. He tells the woman that she has dropped something (something-> the baby) but the woman does not seem to share his opinion. She starts shouting at Chaplin so he has to take the baby again as the woman leaves with the stroller (in the scene of taking again the baby he nearly took the baby that is not the unknown one).  <br/>  <br/> As he cannot take care of him he decides to put the baby again where he found it. He puts it in the floor again but he realised that a police officer was just behind him so takes again the baby and goes away while looking at the police officer. He gets into a different street and he finds an old man walking with a walking stick. Chaplin asks the old man to hold for a minute the baby because he has to tie up his shoelaces. He fakes the action of tiying and when the old man is not looking he runs away. When the old man realises, he also starts to walk quickly after him. <br/>  <br/> Now we are again in the first scenario where we can see Chaplin hiding in a kind of streetwardrove. We see again the old man running with the baby and trying to find Chaplin satisfactorily. However, the old man finds the previous stroller without (the woman is not there) so he decides to put the baby in there and run away.  <br/>  <br/> As Chaplin gets out of his hiding place, the police officer is having a walk over there and finds out that Chaplin is there. When Chaplin sees him he goes just the other way round.  <br/>  <br/> We can see again the stroller with the two babies while some men are passing by. But, is Chaplin the one who is passing by when the woman gets out of the shop and realises that there are, again, two babies. She sees Chaplin so she takes her umbrella and starts running after Chaplin. When she is near enough she kicks him with the umbrella. She also throws him to the floor and kicks him several times when he gets up. She takes him to the stroller in order to him to take away the baby. The police officer, who his walking around hears the noise so he goes to where they are arguing. The woman seems to be very upset and explains to the police officer in a really effusive way what happened. Chaplin tries also to convince the police officer but he realises there is nothing to do with it so he takes again the baby. He goes away, also the woman does and the only one who stays in the place is the police officer who waits several seconds before leaving the scene.  <br/>  <br/> Now, we can see Chaplin again. He is standing up looking around, like he was wondering what to do. He sighs, he changes the baby’s position and he sits in the sidewalk. When he is sat down he puts away his walking stick. Just right him there is sewer which he opens, looks at the baby and he seems to be about putting the baby overthere but he changes opinion and closes the sewer. He looks several times at the baby, he changes again the position of the baby and he licks his fingers because it looks like the baby has bitten him.  <br/> He looks inside the baby’s blanket and finds out that there is a paper. He recolocates the lapel of his jacket and he starts reading it. It is a white note where it is written “Please love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin looks again at the baby, with love, and puts the note inside his jacket while he keeps looking at the baby.  <br/>  <br/> Chaplin smiles, holds harder to the child, takes his walking stick and stands up. He changes direction and starts walking away.

Next, he finds a woman with her baby, so he may think that she is the mother of the baby he has already found. However, she is not the person he is looking for. After that, he returns to the place where he has found the baby previously to leave him/her there.

For this reason, Chaplin does not leave the bay there and continues walking. Next, he encounters a man and Chaplin asks him to take care of the baby while he is doing something with his shoes. In this moment, Chaplin starts running because he does not know what he could do with the orphan baby. Based on this, I believe that Chaplin tries to leave the man he finds on the street with the baby to avoid himself some problems.

Then, he grabs the baby and runs into a woman pushing a baby carriage who seems to have lost something. Chaplin approaches the woman and leaves the baby inside the carriage but she refuses immediately since that baby is not hers. Chaplin, confused, grabs the baby again and leaves the woman behind. He thinks that leaving the baby in the same place he found him/her would be the solution, but a policeman appears making Chaplin to stop his attempt to abandon the baby and leaves. On his way, he encounters a man asking him to hold the baby while he pretends to tie his shoes and starts running. Everything was just fine for Chaplin, but little did he spect that the man would place the baby on the same baby carriage he tried before. Unfortunately, Chaplin walks through the same street where the woman mentioned before was and when she sees him she starts hitting Caplin with an umbrella claiming that he was the one who place the baby inside again. The policeman shows during the argument and Chaplin has to take the baby with him again. Chaplin is really frustrated and upset about the situation, he has to take care of a baby that is not his own, but suddenly he grabs a hand-written note asking to love and care the orphan baby. Hence, Chaplin, due to the moving note, decides to keep the baby with him.

Suddenly, a pile of leaves falls on him, extinguishing his cigarette. Once he lights it again, he discovers a baby behind a barrel. Charles starts looking around for his parents, when suddenly a lady with a stroller passes by and he deduces that the baby is hers. Once he puts the baby in it, the woman notices and gets very angry with him. Charles then decides to leave the baby in the same place where he found him. However, a policeman appears and he prefers to take the baby back to avoid any trouble. Later, he meets an older man and asks him to hold the baby while he ties his shoes. Once he agrees, Charles runs away and hides, willing to get rid of the baby. The older man, without knowing what to do, leaves the baby in the same stroller as before. The woman with the stroller, on leaving the shop, discovers that the baby has been put back there. Just then, Charles crosses her path and the woman, again very upset, hits him with her umbrella. After that, he sits down on the pavement with the baby, and thinks for a moment about putting the baby down a sewer.

Chaplin thinks that the baby is likely to belong to that woman so he puts the baby on the carriage but the woman gets angry and she tells him that the baby is not hers. Chaplin comes back to the street and he leaves the baby again on the floor but when he turns around, he bumps into a policeman and as a consequence he picks up the baby again. Chaplin, with a touch of humour, puts the baby on an unkown man's arms and he runs. The unkown man is now confussed but he finds the same carriage in which Chaplin had left the baby before. The man leaves the baby in the carriage like Chaplin and he goes. The upset woman, that has discovered the baby again in her carriage, sees Chaplin taking a walk so she believes that he was the guilty. The woman givesthe baby back to Chaplin. Chaplin, very desperate, doesn't know how to act, he walks with the baby when suddenly, he sees a note among the blankets of the baby, the note says: ''Please love and care for this orphan child''.

At first, he is declared to be an 'ackward ass' because he seemed to fall at the very beginning after someone threw him some clothes. Afterwards, while he was walking, after he lighted himself a cigar, he found an orphan baby lying on the floor. He picked the baby up from the floor and walked to see if he could find the mother of the child. He saw a woman carrying another baby in a trolley so he could have thought this was the baby's mother, so he left the child within the trolley. However, the woman yelled at Chaplin, because she was not the mother and probably she could have guessed that Chaplin wanted to leave the baby with her. As Chaplin is rejected, he followed his path to try to leave the baby again on the floor, but a policeman appears just behind his back, so he decides to pick the baby up again as there would be consequences for him. He walked around desesperately so that he could find the parents, but unsuccessfully, he saw the woman again and decided to put the baby on the  trolley, but the woman discovered him and started kicking him until he fell on the floor.  Finally, he decided to sit down on the road and started to think about leaving the child there, but he read the note on the baby's blanket and thoughtfully, decided to keep the orphan after all.

Then it can be seen that there are various bricks or something similar falling down on him. But, it appear that someone has taken those objects intentionally to disturb the protagonist of the video. However, it can be elucidated that he does not worry. Therefore, he continues his path along the street. While the scene is happening it can be observed that there is a man next to Chaplin and talking to him. The words that the man is uttering are not distinguisable. Moreover, in the scene there are some break downs to show funny sentences commenting about the pictures. I think that in these comments the character tries to express his feelings. He appears to be careless about the missfotunes he is facing. Next, in the setting the main character finds a poor babby that has been left out in the suburbs. He catchs the baby with himand tries to put the baby in a woman's baby-cart. Consequentlu, the girl returns the unknown baby to Chaplin. She does the later with discontent. Following, it can be seen that Chaplin gives the baby to a random man that is near him. In the consequent scene, the same woman that has returned the baby comes to give back again the baby to Chaplin. Finally, Chaplin tries to throw the baby away. Notwithstanding, he finds a note that express the desire to find a person that takes cares of the baby and he decides to by like his father with affection.

Our protagonist is pretty concentrated in smoking his cigarette when he sees a baby who is crying on the floor. Charles Chaplin decides to place him in a nearby baby carriage of a woman who passes by, but she doesn’t want to take care of the baby so the woman is pretty mad after realizing it. Without any remaining clue about the parents of the newborn, Charles Chaplin returns the baby to his original spot. However, a policeman appears and he has to take the newborn again. The child keeps on crying, so our protagonist leaves him in the arms of an old man and runs back to hide in the first location, hoping to get rid of the baby. Unfortunately, the old man leaves the newborn in the same baby carriage in which Charles Chaplin had tried to leave him, so when the woman sees him again, attacks our protagonist with her umbrella, calling the attention of the policeman and forcing Charles Chaplin to take the baby again. Desperate, he sits down on the curb of the sidewalk, looking at a sewer to see if the newborn would fit in it, although he abandons that idea soon after. Suddenly, Charles Chaplin finds a note inside the clothes of the baby which says “Please love and care for this orphan child” and, moved by these sincere words, he finally decides to keep the newborn with him.

The baby is lying on the floor, so Chaplin takes the boy and he looks around to find if his mother or any member of the family of that baby is near it. In that moment a woman goes through and Chaplin thought she was the mother of that baby. Chaplin proudly gives the baby to the woman and he leaves. However it's not her son and the woman runs after Chaplin and hits him with an umbrella. Therefore Chaplin takes again the baby and put him back where he found it. Unfortunately a policeman saw what he was doing and Chaplin, afraid that the cop took him to the jail, takes again the baby with him. He tries to give the baby to a lame man but again did not work. At the end, Chaplin sits down on the street and he saw a little piece of sheet inside the baby's clothes. It says that he was an orphan so someone please take care of him so Chaplin feels sorry for the baby and adopts him.

By chance, he finds a woman with another baby and goes to give her the baby he has just found, but the woman tells him to go away with him because the baby doesn't belong to her. After that confussion, the man tries to return the baby back to where it was, next to the bin, but a policeman discoveres him and he takes the baby and goes in another direction. Suddenly he finds another man and lies to him to take the baby because he is supposedly preparing his shoes, but runs away.

He takes the baby and, while he was thinking that it had fallen from the buildings, he sees a woman with a baby car (with another baby in it). Chaplin gives her the baby, but she agressively refuses him. He is about to abandon the baby where he first found him, but a policeman catches him. Chaplin takes the baby again and this time he gives him to an old man with a long beard. Chaplin runs and hides on a corner. Curiously enough, the old man puts the baby on the woman's baby car, and when Chaplin is walking next to it, the woman discovers the baby. She gets angry and violently hits Chaplin with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby away. The policeman arrives and Chaplin has to run away with the baby.

The baby is left there with some blankets. Charles looks everywhere to see if someone is missing a baby. Behind him, a woman is seen. She is pushing a pram with a baby inside. Chaplin suddenly thinks that this other baby is also her baby so he leaves the baby in the pram. But it isn't her baby. He catches the baby again and when he is about to leave him where he found him, a police appears. He walks away with the baby. Then, he sees a man and gives the baby to him. This man leaves the baby again in the same pram that has previously appeared. Charles walks next to the pram and the woman starts hitting him with the umbrella because she thinks he has left the baby again. He picks up the baby and sits with him in the pavement. He finds that the baby has a letter which says ""take care of this orphan baby"". And they both together go away."

This fragment has been taken from the movie 'The Kid', and I am going to sum up what I saw. <br/> Charles Chaplin was going through a street when suddenly he found a baby behind some trash bins. Not knowing what he should do, he starts to go around, with the baby on his arms, trying to find him a place to stay. But he realises that another baby's trolley, an old man's arms, or the same place where he found him, are not the best options, as there is a policeman around, and he does not want himself to be accused for something wrongly. At the end, desperated, he sits on the street and discovers that the baby has a note within his clothes which begs love and care as he is orphan. So Chaplin, apparently, takes care about this poor baby and takes him home.

It is black and white and the only sound to hear is the music that follows the actions of the characters. The few times we can ""hear"", actually reading"" what they may say, is in slides that occationally appear. The protagonist, who walks in a silly way along a street, feels anoyed when someone throws things, through the window in the building next to him, and as a consecuence, hitting him. After that, he stops to relax and looks for a cigarrette to smoke. He burns it and start to smoke. Then, he finds an orphan baby and looks for his parents. At the same time, a woman carrying her own baby passes by and the protagonist, who thought that he might be the baby's mother, puts him next to the other baby in the babycar but the woman refuses to keep it since it was not hers. Next, the protagonist thinks of leaving the baby where he found it but a policeofficer enters and the obviously couldn't leave the baby. Looking for another option, he sees another man walking and asks hi to hold the baby while he ""mends a problem he had with his shoes"" but runs away leaving the baby with that man. Now it is his problem. However, that man did not know what to do either and found the same babycar with the previous baby in front of a shop and leaves it there. Then, the mother goes out and finds the baby next to hers and tries to find the person who left him there, when the protagonist appears again and the woman, very agressively, gives the child to him again. He doesn't know what to do and sits on the street. He tthinks on leaving the baby underground but he refuses the idea. Finally, the finds a letter in the baby's clothes telling to whoever would find him to love and take care of that orphan child. The protagonit happily stands up and goes away with, now, his own baby."

Then, he tries to leave the baby right on the spot he found it. However, a policeman stops him and intimidates Charles in order to pick up the baby. Sooner rather than later Chaplin turns left and locates an old homeless man and gives him the little child just to trick him. Running away, Chaplin hides himself from the old man. Nevertheless, this homeless man finds once again the same baby trolley of that women from before and leaves the child on it. In an unlucky turn of the events, Chaplin walks in front of that trolley only to find out that the baby is there and has to pick him up because of the rampaging behaviour of that mather and also of the previous police officer from before who threatens him. Later, in an exhauster condition, decides to seat in the sidewalk, just to come across with a note between the messy dirty bed sheet in which the baby was covered. ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". This was the emotional message written down on that crumpled paper, which made him take the decission of keeping the baby."

He keeps on walking while he is smoking a cigarette, and he is attacked again, but this time by a different person who throws his or her trash out of the window. Chaplin seems a bit angry; however, he checks a box he is carrying with him in order to smoke another cigarette again. Once he starts smoking, he takes off his gloves and decides to throw them in the bin next to him. Just when he throw them away he hears some noise, like a baby crying, so what he does is to turn around and sees that there is a baby alone in the street wrapped up in blankets. He begins to analyse the situation and looking everywhere because leaving a baby in the street is a very cruel act. While he is taking the baby with him, there is a woman with a baby carriage walking behind him. Chaplin sees her so he walks towards her with the intention of leaving her the baby. He leaves the baby in the carriage and the woman beings to argue with him because the baby is not hers; therefore, Charles has to take the baby with him again and wants to leave him in the place where he found him. However, at that moment a pollice officer appears behing him and sees what Charles Chaplin is doing. He is caught in the action and the policeman believes he is abandoning his baby. When Chaplin sees the officer behind him, he quickly takes the baby with him again and starts walking down the street. He runs into a man and gives him the baby with the excuse that he needs to tie his shoes, so he is pretending he is doing that when all of a sudden he runs away. The man notices what Chaplin has done and goes everywhere looking for him but he cannot find him because he is hidden. That man fins a baby carriage in the street so he decides to leave the baby in it and runs away.

At the beginning, Charles Chaplin discovered the lonely child crying his eyes out in the street. Although he decided to take the baby, he changed his tune and firstly tried to leave the baby in a stroller together with another baby. Obviously, the mother noticed and left the scene immediately after without the baby. Later, Chaplin tried to abandon the baby at the very same place where he was found. A policeman saw him and he was forced to take the baby again. Two more attemps were done in order to get rid of the baby. Finally, Chaplin, who was totally desperate, is sitting down the street and he discovered a paper inside the blanket covered the baby body. The baby was orphan and somebody should take care of him. Eventually, Chaplin is out of scene carried the baby smiling.

Since he didn't find anyone, he left the kid in another baby's buggy. However, a woman (probably the other baby's mother) came out of a house very annoyed and gave the child back to Charles Chaplin. He tries to get rid of him/her by going back to the place where he found him. When he places him on the street next to the bin, a police officer sees him, so Charles Chaplin holds the baby again. He gave the baby to an old man who can't walk very well, and then runs away. The old man left the baby in the same baby buggy. The woman came out again, very angry, and exactly at that point Charles Chaplin was walking next to the buggy, so she kicks him and returns the kid to Chaplin.

Chaplin was thinking about a possible manner of leaving the baby without causing him/her any harm when he saw a man wandering. Even though the man seemed to be homeless, Chaplin gave him the baby because he was unwilling to have a child's responsibility.

Suddlenly, he sees something on the ground; he finds it is a baby wrapped in clothes. He is overwhelmed and tries to leave the baby in a baby trolley. The woman, probably the mother, returns the baby to him. A police officer is walking around at the same time, making sure that everything is alright. As a last resort, he gives the baby to an old man walking around and flees; unluckily, this man tries to put the baby in the same trolley as the beginning and the woman, once again, returns it to the protagonist. At the end, the man debates between accepting the newfound orphan baby and abandon him once again, this time permanently. This baby has its story told since the beginning, its fate is written. That person will grow without the love of a family to whom he is no burden to; that person will have a very difficult future. And no one cares. Not the maternal figure, represented in the woman, who has a baby herself. Not the policeman, who subtly wants the man to keep the orphan because it would be easier than doing it himself. Not its parents, that are absent and just leave a note asking someone to take care of their child. And, of course, not the protagonist, who finds himself between the road of empaty or selfishness. And at the end, so do all of us.

He gives the baby to the old man and runs away from there. The old man looks for Chaplin because he doesn't want to care for the baby.

He picks up the baby, and tries to give it to a woman passing by with her own baby. The woman rejects taking care of the baby so Chaplin picks it up again, and tries to return it to the previous place where he found it. However, a police officer catches him in the act so he picks up the baby one more time. Going down the street, Chaplin sees a man and tricks him to hold the baby while Chaplin ties his boots so that he could get out of there without the baby. This man, trying to find Chaplin, sees the same baby carriage where Chaplin had unsuccessfully left the baby the first time, and leaves it there. The woman, furious about this, tries to find a solution when, unfortunately for Chaplin, he passes by in front of the woman. She chases him with an umbrella to pick the baby and carries it with him. Finally, Chaplin decides to take care of the baby since anyone else is willing to do it.

At first, we can see Charles wandering around a poor neighbourhood, when all of a sudden a pile of rubbish is thrown at him. He does not take this into account and proceeds to light up a cigar. Suddenly, he notices that a baby is lying in the ground. Since a woman is walking by with her child, Charles thinks that the baby he has just found is hers. Therefore, he places the baby in the stroller. Nevertheless, she responds angry to Charles owing to the fact that the baby does not belong to her. As a result, he has to take the baby again with him and decides to leave him back in the place where he found him. However, a policeman discovers what Charles aims to do. Despite the fact that he cannot leave the baby there, he eventually finds a man who he asks to hold the baby for a second, which gives Charles time to escape. This man chases Chaplin but he finds a stroller, where he leaves the baby. Charles comes out of the place in which he had hidden and finds the policeman, so he has to run away again. Nevertheless, Charles passes by the stroller and the same woman he had previously encountered tells him furiously that the baby is not hers. Consequently, he has to take the baby. Finally, Charles sits on the ground holding the baby when all of a sudden he finds a piece of paper in which it is asked to please take care and love the poor child. In the end, he decides to take the baby with him and love him.

In spite of his worn-out clothes, he looks pretty classy and elegant: he is wearing a black suit and a bowler hat, and also uses a cane. After having been beaten by some rubbish that have fallen from a window, he searches for a cigar, takes one of the fag-ends that he keeps in a cigarette case, and, after taking off his ragged gloves, he lights it with a match and throw the gloves away. Suddenly, the tramp finds a baby who is weeping desperately on the floor next to some bins.  <br/>   <br/> He picks him up and looks up to see if the baby has fallen from a window too. Then, a woman with a pram passes in front of them and the tramp runs to her to give her the baby, since he thinks she has dropped him accidentally. The woman, who already has a baby of her own, seems to be really upset with the tramp and tells him that that baby is not hers, so the tramp takes him back and put him in the same spot where he found him. However, a police officer is just behind him and the tramp picks up the baby again from the floor. After that, he asks a bearded man to hold the baby for a moment so he can lace his shoe, but that is just a trick to get rid of him and run away. Next, the bearded man follows the tramp to give the baby back to him, but does not find him and puts the baby in the woman’s pram instead. When the woman finds that the tramp’s baby is in her pram again, she hits him with her umbrella, the police officer arrives and she accuses the tramp of abandoning the baby, so he takes him back.  <br/>  <br/> The tramp does not know what to do with the baby. He sits on the sidewalk for a moment and thinks of dropping him in the gutter, but repents of it. Then, the tramp finds a note hidden in the baby’s clothes: it asks whoever who find the baby to love and take care of him. After reading the note, the tramp smiles cheerfully at the baby and walks away with him.

Bothered by the situation, he takes a cigarette from his case and looks around him trying to find the responsible of that action. While he is looking, he notices that, behind him, there is an abandoned baby lying on the floor. A confused Chaplin distinguishes a woman walking down the street with a baby stroller and, therefore, he runs towards her leaving the baby in the troller. When the lady notices about this, she gets mad since she does not recognise the baby. Chaplin and the woman argue and rapidly he comes back with the baby to the place where he found it. Then, he leaves the child again on the floor abandoning it. However, when he tries to escape, a policeman witnesses him. Chaplin takes again the baby and runs. During the chase, he leaves the baby with an old man but, subsequently, the old man leaves the baby with the aforementioned woman and then disappears. Unfortunately for Chaplin, the woman sees him again and assumes that he is the one who has left the baby in the stroller, then the woman, violently, punches him. Chaplin is forced again to take the baby and run. Apparently exhausted, he sits down in the pavement holding the child. Then he notices that within the baby’s clothes there is a note with a message that confirms that the baby is an orphan child. Finally, he opts to adopt it.

Later, when he saw a mother with a buggy and her baby, Chaplin thought the baby he found could probably be hers and put him on that same buggy, but the woman said it was not hers and Chaplin took the baby back again. Thus, he tried to leave this kid back on the floor but he picked him up as soon as he noticed there was a police near him. Worried because of having this small kid, he convinced a man to take him/her for a while while he fled. Unfortunately for Chaplin, this man put the baby back on the mother's buggy without being caught by anyone. Hence, when the mother saw Chaplin again, she made him to take the baby out of his buggy. Finally, this hopeless Chaplin, sat down with the kid on his arms, realized that this was an abandoned baby left with a note. After reading it, Chaplin changed his mind about the baby and we can imagine that he looked after the baby as the paper he read only asked for this baby to be loved as he had been abandoned.

He stops to take a cigarette out of a case and, suddenly, he sees a baby lying on the floor. He picks up the child and realises that, behind him, there is a lady pushing around a pram. Chaplin thinks that the baby must be one of her children and tries to place him in the pram. The lady reacts furiously and obliges him to take his child away.  <br/> Not knowing what to do, Chaplin comes back to where he found the baby and attempts to leave him there again. However, a policeman appears and he is forced to take the baby with him. He decides then to give it to a bearded man who was passing by. The man, who suddenly realised that Chaplin was running away, also tries to get rid of the baby by putting him inside the pram of the woman mentioned before. By chance, she left the stroller unattended while making an errand, so the bearded man has the opportunity to leave the baby in the pram and run away.  <br/> Chaplin, who thinks that he finally could get rid of the baby, passes by the pram when the lady is finding out that she has two babies instead of one. Again she blames Chaplin and starts hitting him with her umbrella until he takes the baby with him and goes away.  <br/> He is despaired up to the point of considering leaving the child in a drain. After discarding that option, he realises that there is a note among the baby's clothes. It says: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". Chaplin, moved by these words, starts feeling bad about the poor baby. He decides finally to do what the note says and takes the child with him."

These citizens who are carrying out this activity are neither aware nor worried about the fact that anyone might be passing by. We are shown this evidence as Chaplin avoids the first one but ends up being thrown the garbage of another person. After this event, which provoked his cigarette falling down, he decides to take another and start to smoke it. This having been done, he finds a baby left on the floor. At first, he thinks he might have been dropped from one of the windows by accident. When he sees a woman with a cart and baby, he thinks the child is hers, so he goes closer to her and tries to leave him in the cart. However, the woman appears after having left the cart and tells him that he is not her son. <br/> Then, he returns to the place where he found him and tries to abandon him, but a policeman shows up. When Chaplin realises that he has witnessed his act, he takes the baby again and leaves.  <br/> Now in another street, Chaplin finds an old man and thinks this is a perfect opportunity to get rid of the baby. Then, he lies to the man and runs away as the old man shouts at him. Chaplin having left, the man moves on to another street with the baby, where he finds the cart of the woman seen before in the movie, and leaves the child there. At this moment, Chaplin, who thought everything was over, reappears, but he is noticed by the woman, who has discovered the unknown baby in her chart. She then hits him and tells him off because she thought he had been the one who had left the baby in the cart. <br/> After this funny episode, Chaplin moves on to another place of the city and sits down on the pavement. When examining the child, he finds out a piece of paper, where he reads that the author begs of the person who found the child love and care towards him. Eventually, he decides to look after the child and the film ends.

Suddenly, he finds a baby on the floor, looks around, and sees no one, so he decides to pick the baby up. He walks holding the baby and sees a woman who appears to be looking for something, and Chaplin puts the baby he had found on the woman's trolley, in front of the woman's child that was already on it. However, it seems the baby found by Chaplin is not the one the woman was looking for, so she reacts violently against him and makes him go away with the baby. Then, Chaplin decides to leave it where he found it, but, right when he was about to do so, a police officer appears and Chaplin has no option but to pick it up again to avoid having problems with the police man. Chaplin then walks again holding the baby, and to get rid of it, he tricks an old man pretending he ties his shoes while Chaplin makes him hold the baby, but runs away insted. Due to a series of some funny coincidences, Chaplin has problems again with the woman he had met before, and with the police man as well. Next, he sits on the sidewalk, thinking what to do, and finds a note within the baby's clothes that says it is an orphan baby. Eventually, he realises the baby has no home or family, and that it is not lost, and he finally decides to keep it.

After that, he gets out of his pocket a metal box from which he takes a cigarrette end that he lights and starts to smoke. He intends to continue walking, but a baby wrapped in sheets calls his attention. He takes the child in his arms and thinks what to do while a woman passes by with a baby trolley and goes towards her, thinking that was her baby. But it wasn't, so the woman angrily tells him to take the kid and go and so does Chaplin. His next idea is to leave the kid in the same spot he found him, so whoever had lost him could find him, but a police officer sees him and thinks he is abandoning the baby so he takes him again and leaves. Desperate, he finds a man to whom he asks to grab the baby and, while he pretends to tie his shoelaces, runs away and hides. At the same time, the other man leaves the baby in a baby trolley he finds in the street, which is by chance the same woman's one. Chaplin gets out of his hideout and when the woman sees him, she hits him repeatedly and starts arguing with him to take the child. In that moment, the policeman comes and Chaplin is forced to take the baby again.

Then, he takes a cigarette. While he's smoking, he sees a baby on the street. He takes it and looks for someone who could have left it there. As he doesn't find anybody, he leaves the baby in a pram he notices. But the pram's woman complains and holds him the baby again. He tries to abandon it on the street, where he found it, but a police man sees him, so he tries to escape, not to get caught by the police man. After that, he leaves the baby with a man, who puts the baby into the previously mentioned pram, and the pram's woman gives the baby to Chaplin for a second time. Eventually, Chaplin sits down and looks at the baby while holding it, when he notices about a hidden paper in the baby clothes. He takes it and reads the message written: the baby is an orphan kid. Chaplin smiles.

As he keeps walking some of the rubbish falls on him. He opens a metal box in which we see several almost finished cigars. He chooses one and lights it. At some point he sees a baby laying on the floor, next to more rubbish. He is quite surprised and looks at the windows wondering if anybody has thrown the baby from a window. He takes the baby in his arms and tries to figure out what to do with it. Then, when a woman with a stroller passes by, Chaplin leaves the baby inside the stroller. However, as soon as the woman realises this, she scolds him and Chaplin has to take the baby again. Later on, he tries to leave the baby on the floor where he had found it but the presence of a police man makes him keep the baby. After that, he tricks someone to hold the baby and runs away. This man who is now holding the child decides to leave it in the same stroller as Chaplin did before. Hence, when the woman with the stoller sees Chaplin, she beats him up and returns the baby to him (now Chaplin cannot get rid of the baby as the same police officer is watching him).  At the end Chaplin sits in the street beside a sewer with the baby in his arms. He watches the gutter considering if the baby would fit in there but decides to keep it in his arms. When he is looking at the baby, he finds some money and a letter in its clothes. The letter says “Please love and care for this orphan child”. So, we see how Caplin gets emotional and decides to keep the baby. He gets up with a smile on his face and leaves.

He stopped to light a cigar and, when he was about to leave, he saw a baby next to the trashcan. He decided to pick it up and find the person who had left him there. In that moment, a woman with a baby stroller was passing by, and he thought that it was hers', so he walked to her and left it in there. However, it wasn't hers', and she started yelling at him. He decided to run with the baby and leave it where he found it, but the police showed up at that moment and he had to pick it up again. As he saw that there was no way to leave it behind, he decided to trick an old man by asking him to grab the baby while he tied his shoes, and then run away. The old man found the woman Chaplin had seen before and left the baby in her stroller again. When Chaplin thought the problem was solved, he passed by the woman again, and she called the police, so he had to take the baby again. Hopeless, he sat in the street walk and thought about dropping him in the sewer, but then he found a note in the baby's blanket. He then realized that he was alone in the world and that it was destiny that put it in his life.

Suddenly, while he is walking through an alley, some debris falls from a building. He shakes off the dirt from his clothes and lights on a cigarette. While doing so, he finds a baby on the floor. Confused, he picks up the baby. He sees a woman passing by with a baby trolley for twins, so he decides to put the baby he has found next to the woman's. When she sees him doing so, she yells at him and tells him to take that baby away. He decides to put the baby back where he found him, in the alley, but he realises there is a policeman looking at him, so he takes it back from the street again. He sees a lame man using a walking stick passing by, and with the excuse that he is going to tie up his shoelaces, he gives the baby to the man, and then runs away. The man runs after him, but Charles Chaplin hides so he doesn't see him. The man then sees the same baby trolley Chaplin had seen before, and decides to put the baby there. The woman realises the baby is there again, and coincidentally Chaplin is passing by, so she yells at him. The policeman sees the two of them arguing so he goes to bring peace. Charles Chaplin is forced to take the baby again. Not knowing what to do with him, he sits on the sidewalk and considers throwing the baby down the drain, but does not do so in the end. He finds a paper between the baby clothes that reads: 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. So, in the end, moved by that note, he decides to keep the baby.

As he is grunting about what has just happened, he takes a cigarette butt out of the tin box he keeps in his pocket. After taking his gloves off, he lights a matchstick with the sole of his shoe and starts smoking the butt. When he is about to set his journey again, his attention is driven to a baby lying on the floor, all wrapped up in blankets. He then sees a woman with a stroller, and he decides to follow her carting the baby in his arms. He tries to make the woman believe that she has dropped the baby out od the stroller, but she does not seem very convinced about that idea as she starts yelling at Chaplin. Then he returns to the same place the flowerpot landed on and he restored the baby to where he found him or her.  <br/>  <br/> At that very moment, a police officer sees Chaplin leaving the baby behind and so Chaplin decides to take the baby with him. As he strolls down the road, he pretends to need to lace his shoes and he entrusts the baby to a man in the street. When that man is distracted with the baby, Chaplin escapes and hides from the man who is chasing him. This latter man also sees that very same woman from before and leaves the baby in the stroller once again, but the woman thinks that it was Chaplin who put the baby inside the stroller and not the bearded man. After being beaten up with an umbrella, Chaplin takes the baby once more, but this time under the watchful eye of the police officer and he leaves.  <br/>  <br/> Chaplin, resigned, sits down on the pavement, and takes a letter from the wrapped baby. The letter says: “Please love and care for this orphan child”. It seems that Chaplin was moved by this short note as he leaves with the baby in his arms.

Chaplin observes there is a woman with a buggy and another baby, so he approaches her and places the baby inside it with the other child. However, the woman gets mad because the baby is not hers. Then, Chaplin takes the baby back to the place where he found him and leaves him on the floor. While he is leaving the baby, a policeman is watching him, so Chaplin takes the child back. Following this, he starts walking again holding the baby. He gives the creature to an old man, pretending he is going to lace his shoes, and runs away. This old man, confused as well, leaves the baby in the buggy again and he goes away. The mother comes out and looks surprised at the child. Then, she sees Chaplin walking by and assumes he was the one who left the baby again, so she hits him with an umbrella. The policeman comes and Chaplin ends up taking the baby. He sits on the floor while holding the child and thinks of putting him into a drain. Afterwards, he reads a note the baby had in his blanket. It sort of touches him and thus, he finally decides to take care of him.

Suddenly, someone throws rubbish to him from above. He stops, swears at the person above and takes a can out of his pocket that contains several half-smoked cigars. He takes one, lights a match with the sole of his shoe and throws his gloves to the bin. He looks to the left to discover a crying baby who has been abandoned on the street. He approaches and checks on him. Then, he looks at the surrounding buildings looking for the possible parents of the child. After seeing nobody, he decides to grab him while a woman with a trolley passes by. Chaplin notices the woman and chases her. When the woman stops to enter one of the houses, Chaplin leaves the child on the woman’s trolley just to see her come back yelling at Chaplin. The woman tells Chaplin, very angrily, that the baby is not hers, so Chaplin grabs the baby again and the woman leaves. Chaplin returns to where he found the baby and leaves him/her there again. When he turns around, he bumps into an officer and immediately turns around to take the baby and leave. As he is walking by, he sees an old man walking with a stick. Chaplin tells the man to hold the baby while he ties his shoe. When the man holds the baby, Chaplin pretends to tie his left shoe and a second after he runs away, leaving the man with the baby. The man chases Chaplin, who hides in a small room next to where the baby was found. The old man, not being able to find Chaplin, leaves the baby on the woman’s trolley. Chaplin exits the room where he was hiding and comes across another officer. He turns around and leaves. In the next scene, two people walk by the trolley and the woman goes out of the shop. The woman sees the baby on the trolley and shows herself incredulously. Chaplin passes by the woman, who takes an umbrella and runs to him. She starts to beat him with the umbrella. She grabs him by the jacket and takes him to the trolley. They start an argument about the baby and the woman calls an officer. The woman explains the situation to the officer and Chaplin takes the baby again, without the officer telling him to. They all leave. Chaplin walks on the sidewalk and drops his stick next to a drain. Then, he sits on the sidewalk to pick up the stick. He opens the drain and looks at the baby, thinking about dropping him inside. He frowns and closes the drain. He stares at the baby and starts talking to him/her. When the changes the baby to his right lap, Chaplin stabs himself with a pin that is on the baby’s blanket. He looks into the folds of the blanket and finds a note, which was held with the pin. He takes out the note and pokes the pin on his blazer. He unfolds the note, which reads “please love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin, moved by the note, looks at the baby and keeps the note in a pocket of his blazer. He starts smiling at the baby, takes his stick and they both leave.

First of all, it is a silent and black and white film which was a very typical thing in those years. The scene stars with Chaplin in the street where he found a baby lying on the floor. Then, a policeman thought that the baby belonged to Chaplin so he had to pick up the baby from the floor. After a while, Chaplin tried many times to get rid of the baby but he did not. Eventually, he found a note where said that the baby was an orphan one, so he decided to take care of him. Through the whole scene, it can be seen that the first option for the actor is to leave the baby wherever. Besides, the first part is more like a comedian one, although when he realised that is an orphan child, the scene is more dramatic.

He runs towards a trolley where he sees another baby and tells the mother of the second baby that the she dropped her other baby, but she scolds him  and he takes the baby and goes away. He is proceeding to leave the baby where he found it but a police officer comes by and he is forced to take back the baby. He founds a man with a limp and drops the baby on that man's arms and runs away. The man chases after him and he hides, so the man drops the baby in the previous trolley again and runs away. When Chaplin passes by the trolley, the mom sees him and chases him while scolding him so he picks up the baby and take it out of the trolley. The police officer is nearby so Chaplin feels responsible for picking up the baby and after walking with it in his arms, he sits down next to a sewer and opens it while contemplating the option of throwing the baby down, but soon after he discovers a letter which was wrapped in the baby's blanket which says something along the lines ""please take good care of me"", so he smiles at that and decides to keep the baby."

While he was doing so, he saw a baby wrapped in blankets lying nearby. He picked up the baby and started looking around looking for his parents. He saw a woman walking by with a baby cart and thought that the baby was probably hers. As soon as he placed the baby in the cart, the woman started yelling at and hitting him because it wasn't hers. Then, Chaplin decided to leave again the baby where he had found it but a policeman saw it and Chaplin picked the baby up again. Afterwards, he made a man sustain it while he supposedly tie up his shoes and ran away. The man encountered the woman at the beginning of the story, placed the baby in the cart and ran away.  A bit later, the woman discovered the baby again in the cart and as she saw Chaplin walking nearby called the police and explained the situation. Chaplin picked up the baby again and after walking some time he sat down on the street thinking what he should do with the baby now. In that moment, he found a little note between the blankets that said that the baby was an orphan and asked whoever founded the baby to take care of him. After that, Chaplin smiled and decided to adopt him.

His cigarette is extinguished from one of these episodes, so he gets another cigarette from his pocket. He lights it and continues walking, but he suddenly hears a baby crying. The baby is lying on the ground, so Chaplin takes it. He looks for the person who might have left the baby there, but since he cannot see anybody else, he leaves the baby in a buggy. However, the woman who owns it sees Chaplin leaving the baby there and starts yelling at him. Chaplin takes the baby from the buggy and starts wondering again. He was going to put the baby back where he found it when a police officer came by and ordered him to keep the baby. Chaplin started walking with the baby when he saw an old man, to whom he tricked to get rid of the baby. Chaplin ran off to hide somewhere. In the meanwhile, the old man left the baby in the buggy where Chaplin had first left the baby. The woman did not see this old man leaving the baby in her buggy, so, later, when she saw Chaplin again, she blamed him. The police officer was around, and she told him about what she thought Chaplin had done. The police officer told him off and obliged him to take the baby with him. Chaplin, hopeless, sat down on the street. He was staring at the baby when he found a note wrapped in the baby's clothes, which said that the baby was an orphan, and asked the person reading it to love and take care or it. Chaplin smiled, stood up and left the scene with the baby.

The main character of the scene finds an abandoned baby in what appears to be a dilapidated building. While questioning how the baby got there, the character finds a woman who is pushing a baby carriage. The man accuses the woman of abandoning the child –since he uses the verb “drop”– but the woman denies the accusation and refuses to take care of the baby. The main protagonist tries to find an alternative way to get rid of the baby, and tricks an unknown man. After a series of events (that unknown man leaves the baby in the woman’s baby carriage, the woman accuses Chaplin of trying to abandon the child, and a police office is closely keeping an eye on him), the character gives up and sits on the kerb.

He stops to smoke and throws away his gloves. He then finds a baby on the street and he thinks that it fell from one of the buildings. He takes him. Then, a woman walks near them with a baby in a buggy and he looks at her. Chaplin goes towards her and, when she is not looking, he leaves the baby in her buggy. She comes back and gets very angry: she shouts at him and he leaves with the baby. He thus leaves the baby where he found it initially but, as he turns back, there is a policeman looking at him. He takes the baby again and leaves. After turning round the corner, he gives the baby to a man on the street, pretending that he is just going to tie his shoelaces. He runs away while the man with the baby follows him. The man then leaves the baby in the buggy in which Chaplin had tried to leave the baby before. While running away from the policeman, Chaplin passes near the buggy and the woman sees him and hits him with her umbrella. They argue and, as the policeman comes, he has to take the baby again. They sit on the pavement and he thinks about leaving the baby in the sewer, but he finds a note in the baby’s clothes that say “please love and care for this orphan child”. He smiles and happily takes the baby with him. <br/>  <br/> Nota: hice primero el ejercicio en español y puede haber influenciado mi forma de escribir ahora

He picked up the baby and tried to put him into a baby carriage which belonged to a lady. She realized and they had a quarrel. <br/> Chaplin tried to put him back where he was found, but a policeman thought he (a father) was trying to abandon his son, hence, he had to look for a different place for the child. After a little while, he found an old man who was unable to walk well due to his disability. Chaplin gave him the child and ran away. The old man could do nothing about it. However, he found the same baby carriage, so he put him into the carriage. The lady, who was shopping, thought that Chaplin was the real guilty guy who placed the baby inside, so they fought and she told the policeman what the situation was about. Therefore, Chaplin had to take care of the baby, since he was not able to throw the baby into the sewer that he found. Finally, he found out that the baby was carrying a note under his blanket. The baby was orphan. Thus, Chaplin decided to keep the baby.

He encounters the same mother Chaplin had already tried to give the baby to and runs away. When Chaplin passes by the woman and she realises the baby is there, she beats him up and screams at him violently. When the same policeman approaches to see what is happening, Chaplin just takes the baby again and goes away to avoid conflict.

Apparently by chance, a woman passes by with a baby trolley and the man, thinking the woman dropped the child unintentionally, places the baby in the carrier. The woman gets really mad that he has tried to place an unknown child with hers and forces him to take it back. After many unsuccessful attempts at getting rid of the baby, the man finds a handwritten letter pleading with whoever found it to care for the child.

Everything is covered in dust and dirt and people are throwing their trash out of the window, and as it is to be expected, Charles gets bathed with one of these garbage rains. He looks up at the person in the window and screams some obscenities before taking a small box out of his blazer to get another cigarette since the one he was previously smoking fell off his mouth with the impact. Putting the box back in its original place and ungloving his hands, Charles takes a match out of his waistcoat pocket and lights it using the sole of his shoe and proceeds to start his cigarette, getting rid of his gloves and throwing them into a trash can near him right after. He's just dusted his hands and taken the first puff when he hears a noise. Looking down to his left he sees a baby wrapped in some thin sheets and blankets lying on the ground. Charles bents down and checks under covers to make sure it is in a baby and then looks around confusedly, trying to find someone, probably someone who could be this kid's parent. Seeing, there's no one, he picks it up, and that's when a woman with a stroller passes by. Charles calls her up but the woman doesn't hear him, so he walks after her. However, when he catches up and gets to the stroller, the woman is nowhere to be seen, so he does what he considers logical and puts the baby in it, next to the woman's kid. The woman reappears seconds after and Charles tells her ""she's dropped something"" and attempts to leave, but the woman won't let him. Gesticulating and making her anger very visible, she gets Charles to take the baby back into his arms, but not before he mistakenly tries to pick up the wrong kid, which only makes the woman more agitated. After the encounter both people go their separate ways, Charles going back to the corner where he found the baby with the intention of leaving him there, never realising he's being watched by a police officer that's standing right behind him. The baby barely gets the chance to touch the ground because, as soon as Charles turns around and sees the expression of the imposing officer, he quickly changes his mind and picks the baby back up, walking away from the officer immediately. Once he's far enough, Charles tries his luck again. Seeing an old man, he stops him and gets him to hold the baby with the excuse of needing to tied his shoes. Charles kneels down just long enough for the old man to believe the lie before he sets off running to go and hide. The old man goes in his search, but not being able to find him, decides to do what Charles had done earlier and puts the baby in the woman's stroller that is now next to a shoe store and runs away. The woman shows up a moment later and is looking at the two babies incredulously when she sees Charles, who's has left his hiding place, walk past her without a care. She runs after him and attacks him from behind with her big umbrella, tackling him down to the ground where she keeps hitting him. This diverts into a heated discussion that only finishes when the police officer reappears and both the woman and Charles leave with their respective babies. Charles then sits on the pavement, with the baby still in his arms, contemplating what to do next. A manhole cover next to him catches then his attention.  He lifts it up, briefly considering whether he could do what he's thinking of doing, but then disregards the idea within a second. It's then, looking at the baby, that he realises there's a note stuck to its clothes, a note which reads ""Please, love and care for this orphan kid"". Charles doesn't have the heart to get rid of the kid after that. He looks down at the kid and smiles. Taking the walking stick he had laid next to him on the pavement, he gets up and leaves, holding the baby protectively against his chest."

In the moment he takes the baby from the floor he sees a lady with a buggy behind him, so he thinks that the lady might have lost the baby. He walks towards the buggy and place the baby inside while the woman is inside the building. When the woman leaves the building she reacts like that baby is not her kid and she asks (or probably imposes) Chaplin to pick the kid and leave, at first Chaplin attempts to take the other baby but she indicates that the baby he was trying to take wasnt the one he had put in the buggy before, then he picks up the right baby. Chaplin walks away with the baby and tries to leave the baby where he found it, next to the rubbish, but a police officer appears and Chaplin takes the baby back. In the next scene, Chaplin asks another gentleman to hold the baby while he pretends to tie his shoes, when Chaplin has the chance he runs away and hide. The gentleman tries to follow him but he can't find Chaplin, however he finds the lady's buggy and place the baby in it, one more time. When the woman sees the baby again she starts looking across the street and when she sees Chaplin she hits him with her umbrella, they start arguing because none of them want to take the baby, the police officer appears again and Chaplin, scared of the officer, take the baby and goes away. In the last scene, Chaplin seats on the edge of the pavement, next to a drain, Chaplin opens the drain, with the idea of throwing the baby inside it, but he doesn't do it. Finally, Chaplin finds a note inside the baby's clothes saying that the baby is an orphan and asking to the person who finds the note to take care and love the child.

While he is walking and smoking, somebody is throwing debris to the street from a window.  <br/> He keeps walking. Then, near some rubbish bins, some rubbish falls on him from above. He looks up to see who did that and retrieves a metal box from his jacket pocket. Inside, cigars and cigarettes can be found. He takes a cigarette and removes his gloves; after that, he lights a match in his right sole to light his cigarette. Then, he throws his gloves away and looks to his left. There, next to the rubbish bins, a baby, wrapped in blankets, lies on the floor.  <br/> He touches the baby carefully and looks around as if trying to find whose baby this is. Since he finds nobody, he holds the baby. While he is trying to find its parents, a woman pulling a baby stroller appears in the background. He calls her and runs towards her. And, immediately after reaching her, he places the baby in the stroller, where there is already another baby. The woman, surprised, starts yelling at him and tells him to hold the baby again, as it is assumed it is not hers. He obeys, but almost takes the wrong baby. Finally, he retrieves the right baby from the stroller and runs away from the woman.  <br/> He goes back to the corner where he found the baby and puts it in the same place. A police officer appears. He blows a kiss to the baby but after seeing the police officer he takes the baby again.  <br/> He starts walking and sees another man, with a cane, on his way. He asks him to hold the baby while he cleans his shoes as he stepped into a muddy puddle. Once the stranger is holding the baby, Chaplin runs away. The stranger follows him as fast as he can, but Chaplin finds a place with a door open and hides there. In his search, the stranger finds the abovementioned stroller and, since nobody is watching it, he puts the baby inside and runs. When Chaplin leaves his secret place he finds the police officer on his way so he starts walking fast in the opposite direction. Then, the previous woman returns to her stroller and finds two babies instead of one. So, when Chaplin passes by them, she calls him in the middle of the street. However, he pretends not to have heard anything and keeps walking. So she starts running after him and hits his head with her umbrella until he is lying on the floor. She grabs him and takes him with her until they both reach the stroller. Then, she warns him to take the baby. In fact, as the police officers passes by, she calls him to inform about their situation. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby again and everybody resumes their way.  <br/> After a few steps, Chaplin drops his cane by a sewer. So he sits down to retrieve it and lifts the top of the sewer thinking about putting the baby there. Nevertheless, he thinks twice and rejects this idea. While he is figuring out how to hold the baby and his cane at the same time, he finds a letter between the baby's blankets indicating to love and care for that orphan child. After reading it, Chaplin feels sorry for the baby, keeps the letter in his inner pocket and smiles at the baby. He stands up and eventually takes the baby with him.

He is thrown trash from above him, and after that he opens up a small metal box containing cigars, he takes one and lights it to smoke it. Next to where he is standing, he finds a baby and assumes he/she is the child of a lady who's walking in the alley as well, pushing a baby stroller with another baby in it. The main character approaches her and gives her the baby, but the child is not hers so the protagonist leaves the baby where he found it. Just as he is doing that, a police officer shows up and gives him a judgemental look, making the protagonist take the baby again. He then finds an old man and gives the baby to him before running away. This old man leaves the baby in the stroller of the lady when she is not looking and runs away. While he does that, Chaplin's character encounters the police officer again and runs away from him. He is caught by the woman, who assumes he was the one to put the baby in the stroller and she follows him to beat him. The same police officer appears again and the woman explains the situation to him, which leaves no choice for the protagonist other than to take the baby. He is desperate and even considers putting the baby in a sewer, but finds a note attached to him/her that says: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". This ultimately convinces him to 'adopt' the baby."

Someone, probably some workers, is throwing rubble from the window of a building, which almost hits the man. He keeps walking, until another worker throws more rubble through another window; this time, the protagonist gets hit. He gets angry and insults the worker; he also realises he has lost his cigarette, so he picks another one from a metal case and lights it. He intends to keep walking, when he notices a little baby lying on the floor, wrapped up in a blanket and crying. The man looks around to see if the baby has fallen from a window, and he picks him up. Suddenly, he sees a woman pushing a baby buggy, with another kid in it. The man comes closer and leaves the baby inside the buggy, but the woman yells at him and tells him to take the baby out of the buggy.  <br/>  <br/> The man picks the baby and he intends to leave the kid where he was lying, but a policeman shows up, so the man has to pick him up again. He walks with the baby in his arms until he sees an old man walking down the street. He asks him to hold the baby with the excuse of tying up his shoelaces, but once he leaves the baby in the old man's arms, he runs away. The old man doesn't know what to do, but he sees a baby buggy on the street, so he leaves the baby in it. The same woman that appeared before comes out of a shop, and she gets very angry when she sees the baby in the buggy again. Suddenly, the protagonist of the video shows up, so she thinks he has left the baby there and runs after him to beat him with her umbrella.

As he walks past the buildings, some of the people inside throw rubbish out the windows, hitting the tramp. When he reaches the foreground, and after cursing the last person who's thrown his or her rubbish on him, he searches for his cigarette box in his jacket pockets. There are only butts in his box, but he lights one and smokes. He removes his mittens in the process to do it more easily, but then decides to just throw them away instead of putting them back on or in his pocket. <br/>  <br/> At that precise moment he hears a baby crying next to him, and finds him on the ground, wrapped in some blankets, by a rubbish can. The tramp looks up, thinking that maybe someone has thrown the baby away through the window with the trash. He lifts the infant. Behind him a lady passes with a pushchair. The tramp sees her and walks up to her to give her the child--""Excuse me, you've dropped something""--says the tramp to her. If he is either innocently trying to return the baby to his mother, or cunningly trying to get rid of the child, we are not told; his attitude is ambiguous. The tramp then tries to leave the baby in the pushchair. The lady, outraged by what she perceives as the tramp's knavery,  rebukes him severely and forces him to take the baby back with him. <br/>  <br/> When Charlot is about to leave the child back where he found him, a policeman catches him red-handed, so he sees himself in the obligation to take the baby with him again. After that, he comes across a bearded hobo, and pretends he has to do his shoelace to ask him to hold the baby for a second, taking advantage of this to escape without the baby. He runs off and hides; the bearded vagabond looks for him, but, unable to find Charlot, he tries to leave the baby in a pushchair he sees at the door of a shoe-shop. He walks off. Charlot gets out of his hideout, but stumbles upon the police officer, which makes him turn around and take the opposite direction. The lady he encountered before steps out of the shop where the pushchair was, and just at that moment he passes by. This coincidence makes the lady think it is him again who has tried to sneak another baby in her pushchair. This time the furious lady beats the tramp violently with her umbrella. The policeman arrives while they are quarreling, and in consequence the tramp has no choice but to take the baby again with him. <br/>  <br/> As he wanders along the sidewalk with the child in his arms, the tramp drops his cane stick. He sits on the curb, picks up his stick and suddenly notices the gutter. He considers for a dramatic moment to throw the baby down the gutter, but discards the brutish option. He begins examining the child, who bits his finger. Thus, he finds a piece of paper among the baby's clothes, with a message written on it: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". This message at last convinces him to take responsability. He smiles at the baby, gets up and walks off with him."

In the first scene of the video, Chaplin is in the middle of an alley, where people are throwing away what seems to be rubble and dirt until one person throws rubbish upon him. In a close-up image of Chaplin, we can see he is wearing mittens and grab a cigarette just before seeing a baby abandoned in the middle of the alley. As he does not know what to do with this child, he tries to get rid of him in different ways. First, he tries to get the baby in a lady’s baby pushchair, with another baby in it. He is caught, so he tries to leave the baby in the same place he found it, being caught again by a police officer. In his third attempt, he manages to do get rid of the baby, leaving him with a bearded man. However, eventually, the baby ends up again in the lady’s pushchair and as she recognises Chaplin, she told him off and calls the same police officer that was patrolling there. Finally, Chaplin, just when he is about to leave the kid in the sewage system, finds a note, in which someone wrote that this kid is an orphan and requests that whoever has found him to take care of him. This final letter seems to be the conclusive reason for Chaplin to adopt the child.

He stops, brushes off the dust and takes out a cigarrette tin. The tramp takes off his  worn off gloves, of which most fingers are missing, and carefully selects a cigarrette stub from an assortment of cigarrette and cigar ends, lights it striking a match on his sole. He throws away the match into a bin and then throws the gloves too. After walkin on a few steps, he finds a little  baby lying on the floor, picks it up and looks up as if the baby could have fallen off a window. The tramp turns around and sees a woman pushing a big perambulator carrying one baby, he imagines she dropped the baby he found and puts it inside the perambulator but the woman complains, so he takes the baby again and puts it carefully where he found it but as he's about to leave the baby a policeman arrives so The tramp turns immediately, picks up the baby again and goes away. <br/> While The tramp is carrying the baby, he walks by a passer-by, pretends to have to tie his shoelace and ask the unknown to hold the baby but as soon as the passer-by has the baby in his hands, the tramp runs away. The unknown sees a perambulator outside a shop, puts the baby inside and leaves. As The tramp is walking by, the mother and owner of the perambulator comes out of the shop, discovers the second baby and guesses the Tramp has done it again. She chases him and hits him with her umbrella back to the perambulator. When they are discussing about the baby the same cop arrives again and The tramp takes the baby and leaves. He sits on the curb and considers throwing the baby into the sewer but on second thoughts he doesn't and pets it. Something pricks his finger and he finds a note saying please love and care this orphan child. He decides to do it.

He is struggling to avoid the rubble while smoking a cigar when he suddenly sees a baby lying on the floor. He picks it up and brings it to a woman carrying a pram, who refuses to take him though. Back with the baby, Chaplin gives the kid this time to an old man, trying to avoid the policeman who is following him. However, the old man puts the baby again in the pram of the woman, making her mad. Chaplin has no option but to take the kid and leave. He finally ends pitying the baby and taking care of him.

Chaplin	written_online	30	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English)	From afar comes a man, actually, he is Charles Chaplin, he wears a scruffy suit, a hat and big shoes. This bizarre outfit gives him a funny air. He has a cigarette between his lips and when he blows the smoke comes as if he was a steam locomotive. He walks like nothing around him matters, like he is oblivious of his surrounding. He passes below an open window, from which a man appears and throw something white, perhaps dust or flour, who knows. Mr. Chaplin looks at the fallen thing just for a second and continues with his walk in that clumsy way he has. He approaches and gets closer and closer. And while he walks, he changes the cane he is holding from one hand to another and plays with it and bends it. Suddenly, something from above falls on his head and this time it really bothers him. He looks up and down trying to find from where that thing comes. Then, from his pocket he gets a tin, a tobacco tin, he opens it and take one cigarette. Then, he takes the tin back to his pocket and after removing his gloves he lights the cigarette and starts smoking again. He gets rid of the gloves by throwing them into a bin and when he looks at his right he finds a baby crying wrapped up in a blanket. He looks everywhere trying to find his parents. “Where this baby comes from?”, he seems to wonder. He takes the baby in his arms and in the distance he sees a woman pushing a baby buggy. Thinking that perhaps she is the baby’s mother, Mr. Chaplin puts the baby inside the buggy. When the women finds out, she starts yelling at him and he can do nothing but to take the baby away and retrieve the poor thing to his or her original place. However, a policeman just appears from nowhere and looks at him in an earnest way that makes Mr. Chaplin take the baby again in a rush and leave. Afterwards, he finds an old man walking in a cane; he gives the baby to him and flees. The old man goes after him but Mr. Chaplin hides away. In his way, trying to find Mr. Chaplin, the old man just by chance finds the baby baggy mentioned above and leaves the baby inside it and runs away. When the woman finds out that there was an “intruder”, she gets really crossed. The funny thing is that Mr. Chaplin walks in front of her own eyes, so the women goes after him shouting and raising her umbrella and pointing it at him. She starts striking him repeatedly, shouting at him and demanding an explanation. The policeman appears and approaches since these two are enrolled in an argument, the woman explains what has just happened and Mr. Chaplin just takes the baby away once again. He seats down and next to him finds a gutter and opens it. For just a moment, he weights his possibilities. However, something happens: the baby carries a note which reads “Please, love and care for this orphan child”. Mr. Chaplin looks at the baby with compassion and kindness, takes him in his arms and without raising his eyes from him, leaves the scene.

Chaplin	written_online	3	Outside classroom	""	At first, we see Chaplin walking through the city until he stops to smoke a cigarette. He, then, founds a baby wrapped in a blanket but because he is unable to find the baby's parents, he tries putting it back where he found it. At the same time, a policeman appears and obviously thinks it is Chaplin who is abandoning the baby so he is forced to take it with him. He tricks a random man into holding the baby and then takes off. However, after turning a corner, he founds himself accused of abandoning the baby by a woman and ends up with the baby in his arms again. After all, it seems like Chaplin is destined to care for the baby and takes it with him.
