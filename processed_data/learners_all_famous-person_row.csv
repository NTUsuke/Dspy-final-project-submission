Well, in fact, I am a big fan of the character that he plays. He is Sheldon Cooper in Big Bang Theory. In my opinion, he is one of the funniest characters ever. I love the way he talks and all his weird thoughts. He does not understand what does sarcasm mean and it causes amusing situations, he takes everything literally. His reactions are amazing. It seems that he does not have feelings and his face does not change at all: it does not matter if he is feeling happy or sad.

The frog was called Ruperta and it lived inside a cristal box, where the child has created an perfect atmosphere for her with water and plants. But one day, while the child was sleeping, the frog jumped out of the box and scaped. When the child woke up and realised that the frog wasn't in her place, he started to cry desesperatedly.

Although their upbringing may have been tumultuous, they have always achieved their goals by striving. They had no option but to face their fears, and so they did. Among those who deserve to be praised, there is one who sticks out from the rest: Nelson Mandela.  <br/>  <br/> Nelson Mandela is widely known to have lead SouthAfrica to freedom and democracy. It was because of his effort and beliefs that the Apartheid was demolished and racism in SouthAfrica came to an end.  <br/>  <br/> Nelson Mandela had been imprisoned for almost 30 years, but suddenly the revolution began as an outbreak of rioting and Mandela was released from prison. However, he detached himself from these violent events by finishing them with his peaceful words and assertions. He was so praiseworthy a man that he did not take revenge on the former leaders of the country for having despised the black community, but he invited them to join forces with him to make a new country instead.  <br/>  <br/> Something that makes him the most praiseworthy man is that he always made the most of his leadership so as to fight for everyone in his country. He also won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. But he won something better than that. He won the respect and praise of everyone in the world. That is why I consider him as the most praiseworthy man in history.

Barack Obama came to break down the walls that divided the American society. His policies aimed to create a fairer country for everyone. For example, he tried to set up a national healthcare system so that poor people did not need a private insurance to be able to go to hospitals. He also promised that he would shut down Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but he could not keep his promise due to an unfavourable situation in the American Senate and House of Representatives. His cool and fresh style has been unique, but nowadays politicians such as Justin Trudeau are trying to approach the citizens with the same strategies that Obama followed.  <br/> Donald Trump's style is different from Obama's style. We still do not know whether Trump is going to be as esteemed as Obama or not, but it is obvious that they are completely different characters.
