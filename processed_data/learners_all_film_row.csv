Guddu did not want him to come because they had to work the whole night, but Saroo was so stubborn and finally, he could go with his older brother.  <br/>  <br/> While they were working, Saroo was so sleepy and he could not help sleeping on a bench. Guddu had to go somewhere so he told his brother not to move from that bench. But, when Saroo woke up, he started looking for Guddu in one of the trains at the train station he had slept for a while. Suddenly, the train started moving and he travelled to the other part of India. <br/>  <br/>  When he arrived, he could not tell anyone where he was from or even the name of her mother. So he survived living on the street with other kids like him. After a few months living in that conditions, he could live in a orphanage where he was not treated so good. Staying there he could be adopted by a family in Australia with a beautiful house in a nice neighbourhood. There, he lived so happy, and his parents adopted another boy who was a little bit trouble maker. He could study for being a recepcionist at a hotel. <br/>  <br/> When he was 26 years old, he realized he wanted to meet her family so he started searching for places he could remember using Google Maps, after being months and months searching, he recognized the street where his house was.  <br/>  <br/> He told his parents in Australia that he wanted to go there to see his biological family and they completely understood, so when he arrived there his mother and his sister recognized him, and they all were so happy.

The same directors that the famous American Horror Story. His genre is drama with comedy and action. Perfect balanced. I really really recommend it.

So far in the family, the person who was always in charge of taking care of the children and their affaires was the mother, whereas the family father was an informatic who was the one that brought home the bacon. <br/>  Later in the film, the woman told her husband to travel abroad together in lrder to celebrate their aniversary, but in the last moment her husband told her that he could not afford going with her because of his work. This really made her upset and she went on travel with her friend, telling her husband that he should be now in charge of the children (he did not complain about that). <br/>  The thing is that once she was already abroad and the family father was in charge of the family alone, he realised that it wasn't as easy as he imagined. He had quite a lot of problems trying to compaginate his work with his children affaires, and although he tried his best to do it, he finally had to quit from his work to take care of them in the right way. <br/>  When his wife came back from the trip they had changed their roles inside the family, since from that moment the father was ghe one in charge of the children and the mother was focused on her new work and bringing money to home.

During the whole movie, the latter one will be helping and assisting Rick, since he works for him and he is the sucessful man working in the film industry. Cliff, on the other hand, it is just somebody who lost his job and now, together with Rick, they are very closed friends and at the same time Cliff is working for Rick. The things will become harder when Cliff goes where the family Manson lives and his presence is not very welcomed.

During the movie, this clown kept scaring people that came on his way. Most of the time, the scene takes place in a house, where the clown looks for his victims in order to kill them. It is very convenient since it is based on a halloween night, so some characters are already wearing some costumes and the clown is not perceived as a maniacal in the beginning.

At the end of that one, Bishop (the main character) pretends his own death because he wanted to leave his world full of risk, guns, and destruccion. But in the new film, his girlfriend has been hijacked and he has to kill some powerful people in the name of those hijacker, because they have told him that if he doesn't kill them, they would kill his girlfriend. However, instead of killing the last objective, he tries to set a trap to the hijackers with the help of the last man. After a hard fight in a ship (that exploted at the end) the girl was rescued but Bishop died with the explosion. Or we though that he did, because at the end, they show us a little space from where he appears. After that, he meets again his girlfriend.

It was recorded and filmed in Germany and it belongs to the expresionist cinema period. The decorations are very interesting because they reflex perfectly this movement (the expresionist one) with the rare representation of the streets and the proyection of the light. The film is about a writter who visits with his friend a fair and ends up entering in an attraction exposed as ""el gabinete del doctor caligari"". Inside the tend there's a weird doctor who's giving a show to all the spectators. The show consists in his attempt and achievement of waking up a guy who has a dreaming transtorn. The doctor claims that the guy with the trastorn knows everything so anybody could ask anything to be answered. The writter's friend asks him when he would  die and he answered ""that night"". Next morning the writter's friend was found dead. The day before another murder was committed. The writter decides to investigate that case because he thought that the murderer was the doctor. He spent all night watching out doctor's loan but he found no evidences to accuse him. Finally it is discovered that the dreaming transtorn's guy was the murderer because the doctor had been hypnotising him while taking advantage of his illness. The end is really surprising because we actually found out that the writter, has gone mad and everything was made up with by his own mind. The plot reminds us on ""Shutter island"",a posterior film that ends in the same way."

In addition, he has a mental illness and he laughs for long periods with a strange and nasty laughter. <br/> In the end, he becomes even more mad and violent. He appears in a comedy program and kills whoever he fancies, his idol and people from the audience. A series of events happen in between and he results in a social figure admired by a mass of individuals. The reason to do this, is protesting against the current system. Political and social instituitions do not carry a substantial job. The moral of the film is that past traumas can have a big infuence on people.

In the story,  Rose and Jack are the main characters, two passengers who would take part in the Titanic experience, a  technological British enterprise of greatness and luxury.  <br/> However, they belong to completely opposite social classes. Whereas Rose is from upper class level, Jack is a poor man who won a third-class ticket to sail the ship by playing poker.

Nevertheless,  Jack finally dies, getting frozen in the icy waters, while Rose stays on a boat staring at him and crying over his corpse.

After a long thinking she gets convinced by her daughter to go to a dinner with the groom's parents. They are kings.  <br/> The groom's mother, who is the evil character of this film, makes Maleficient angry in order to ambush her and let the rest think that she has cursed the king.  <br/> Her daughter gets angry with her and refuse to go home, so Maleficient goes away. In her path, she gets shooted by the queen's assistant. Suddenly, a creature that looks like Maleficient save her and take her to a land where live lots like her. She didn't know about the existence of that place. There, she gets told that she is the Queen of that place and that she is the Fenix.  <br/> Meanwhile in the groom's kingdom, they are preparing the wedding. All the creatures of the swamp get invited but not for a good reason. Maleficient's daughter finds the truth while almost all the creatures are being killed by the queen's assistant inside the church.  <br/> Maleficient's siblings go to the kingdom too to kill all the humans due to a hugehate caused by the humans' try of exterminating them.  <br/>  <br/> Maleficient's daughter gets locked up in her room by the guards and when everything seems to get lost Maleficient arrives and saves everyone.

The man tell the students that even he says he works as a plague controller, he’s indeed the one who holds off all the trolls over the Scandinavian countries. The film is a false documentary where the students are filming the hunter’s methods and instruments, and they film how the trolls behave in a natural environment, something the Government has tried to hide from the public eye. It’s a very interesting take on a “false documentary” with good 3D animation, and a really unique way to represent the Scandinavian and, more specifically, the Norwegian mythology.

At first, it was difficult for her to get used to the new lifestyle that was presented before her, though she gradually becomes part of the royal family and begins to enjoy the luxury that such a life can bring to the table. However, an excessively expensive lifestyle and the vice of gambling plus many bad decisions that the monarchs had made, eventually provoked a great loss of wealth that the French people do not tolerate. The general discontent of the population leads them to assault Versailles.

She dies some days after but she becomes a zombie and bites the nurse who was assisting her. Little by little they start biting everyone else and the guy doesn't know what to do, he's surrounded by death itself and more or less cursed. Eventually his girlfriend helps him get out of that situation and the house with all the zombies inside gets burnt, so at the end of the film get rid of all the zombies.

It shows the beginning of the fascist movement in Spain, seen from Miguel de Unamuno's persperctive, a well-known writer who was in charge of the University of Salamanca. He does not share the ideólogy of the new movement but defend it as being as bad as the republic one. However, the disappearance of his friends led him to meet personally the leader of the fascists to ask him to find them or to liberate them, but to no avail. Consequently, as he was invited to give a speech for them for being an intelectual person, he decided to attack their system and the unfair violence employed in it. He almost got killed but he was saved in the last moment by Franco's woman, who was an admirer of his texts."

Although I was not eager to watch it, as Spanish films do not tend to meet my expectations, I finally decided to give it a chance. <br/> The cast was definetely amazing: Mario Casas, José Coronado, Bárbara Lennie... In fact, they all are definetely talented actors. Besides, the plot was so interesting and extremely addictive. It all starts when a couple (Adrián Doria and Laura Vidal, his lover), has an accident in the middle of a forest. They accidentally kill a boy, who was coming back home in that precise moment. Both of them start to panic, as they see how their lifes might dramatically change just because of a traffic accident which was not even their fault, since it was all provoked by a deer's jump. Laura decides to avoid phoning the police and solve the problem themselves. She asks Adrián to shed the cadaver and he obbeys her. <br/> While Adrián looks for a place to get rid of the boy, Laura asks for help. A man who had been driving over there, finds her and invites her home in order to repair her car. She accepts and a succession of strange events, which I will not reveal so you can enjoy this amazing film, start happening from this point on. <br/> At the beginning, the film seems not to have any sense at all, but it reminded me of a puzzle: every single detail is relevant and everything gains meaning. <br/> Have you ever thought about your life? Have you ever considered destiny as a relevant factor in your life? All these questions and some others are answered in the film. Furthermore, it really made me reflect about how easy is to lose it all just because of small details. Every decision has its consequences, which can turn your life from a paradise to a hell."

As strange as its title, Big Fish is about Edward Bloom adventures along his life. This comes because Edward was at the end of his life and he and his son didn't talk to each other for the last 3 years, since Will, his son, hated that his father was always talking about a legendary fish that lived in the river near their town and nobody was able to catch it but him the day Will was born. His father always took the protagonism so Will was full of this and their relationship cooled down. Along the film, Edward talks about his life and everything is like a fantasy world, since when a story ends, Will always says that he invented almost the entire story. Edward says he met a witch, a man who was 3 meters tall, he worked in a circus, etc. He also tells the story of how he met Will's mother, the love of his life. By the end of the film, Will realices that he loves his father and that the legendary fish is somehow is father, since even if it was impossible to catch (he was a wild soul all his life) when he was born the fish was catched by him (having a kid made him settle down and realice how much he loved his son). It's a bizarre film, worth of watching if you don't have anything better to do, nice to see in a moment of boredom.

It is a Netflix film which is basically about a girl (Lara Jean) who has been writing secret love letters addressing boys from her high school. Her sister discovers the letters and sends them to the boys without telling Lara. When they read the letters, they seem to be very surprised and start to care about her. Moreover, she starts a fake relationship with one of the boys, just to show that she is not in love with the rest of them. In conclusion, I would say that although it is a predictable teen film, I found it very original and it also made me think about how young people express their emotions through writing.

After having won the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) Francisco Franco established a dictatorship, in which the first years were tremendously violent for those who didn't share his ideologies. Nevertheless none of these facts could discourage the thirteen roses, who fought for their beliefs until the very end of their lives. <br/>  <br/> Despite their young  age - most of them were under-age, these women fought and worked secretly for the reinstatement of the Spanish Republic and against the dictatorship regime recently set up. They were therefore arrested and jailed and it is during the wait for their trial that they all meet. Meanwhile a macabre process of interrogation in which human rights are clearly attacked takes place. Moreover the vulnerability of life during these periods is clarified; one of the prosecuted is a fascist side defender but faces the same destiny after being caught hiding at her home a friend of hers, a sympathizer of the Republic. <br/>  <br/> The movie is a representation of one of the darkest chapters in Spanish history. It is a moving story that brings the onlooker to tears, feeling anger, impotence and hence making it impossible not to  put themselves in the protagonists' shoes. In my opinion, a marvellous film.

In order to do so, they need to send a pilot to a black hole, hoping that he can jump on time and fix the situation that led to such a complicated scenario. The pilot chosen to do that task is a marine veteran now converted into a farmer, who lives with her father and his two daughters. At first, he is reluctant to go, but he finally accepts when he realizes that if the situation doesn't change they will starve anyway. While he is in space, time flows differently on earth, and he has to see how his children grow up without him and go through complicated times, which makes him go into a state of mind in which he can hardly differentiate reality from fiction.

The teacher asked the children to change the world. For that reason, this was a task for the children to complete along the whole year. However, the teacher didn't expected what the little boy was going to do.  <br/>  <br/> This kid lived with his mother, who had alcohol problems. His father left them, but sometimes he returned. The boy hated when his father came home because he hit his mother. <br/>  <br/> Thinking about the task proposed by his teacher, the kid designed a method to change the world. It was like a chain of favours. Following this chain, you have to do something for three people, and these people have to do the same with another three, and so on and so forth. <br/>  <br/> Although thinking the boy's idea was brilliant, anyone expected it to really change the world. However, this chain of favours worked out pretty well and many people heard of it and participate. Thus, even the press wanted to know the origin of this movement of kindness, and a periodist found the boy.

I really enjoy watching this film since I am a huge fan of Jane Auten's novels and besides, Keira Knightley is one of my favourite actresses of all times. <br/> When I try to explain the reasons behind my fanatism in relation to this film, I end up talking about the brilliant performance by the actors and the impressive scenery presented all through the film such as the  magnificent landscapes in the Midlands. <br/> Regarding the plot of the movie, we first encounter the Bennet family, a not that wealthy family that has enough incomes to sustain themselves. It is composed by Mr.Bennet, Mrs.Bennet and their five daughters. They live a normal life until the arrival of Mr.Bingley in the town. He comes along with the presence of his sister and Mr.Darcy. Althought in the beginning Mr.Darcy despises Elizabeth, he ends up falling in love with her and overcome their prejudices as they get married at the end of the novel.

Suddenly, they start hearing weird noises from outside and inside the house. Some scenes show strangers disguised in creepy fancy dresses. They stared at the main characters of the film, then they tried to kill them. Finally, they succeeded in their duty and left the house. We can see at the end of the movie that they were mormons.

One of the kids is a 6-year-old girl called Scout and the other one is called Jem and he's 10. Their father gets a case to defend a black person, but he fails to prevent him from being convicted, declared guilty. This person is finally killed in prison. The children are very affected by this situation, since they have good hearts and know that the black person was actually innocent, so when the jury declared him guilty they felt that they didn't do justice. There is another plot line that is important in the story. The kids are interested in one of their neighbours who seems to be described as a mysterious and evil person, but they end up discovering that he is a good person and he even saves their lives. So we can say that both the black person and this neighbour are mockingbirds becasue they don't hurt anyone and are good people.

Mr. Anderson, the main character, seems to represent the typical office worker that wears grey clothes, lives on pre-cooked food and doesn't have much of a social life. In fact, he doesn't have a life at all. He embodies the realization that the so-called american dream is a rat trap, in which we all run inside a wheel day after day in order to make the system work, and believe we enjoy free will. That is actually both the introduction and the following 2-hour development. The actual plot is a dystopia set in 2199 in which the world has been completely destroyed after a war between men kind and artificial intelligence. Finally, robots took control of the world and now grow humans and connect them to a system that gathers their energy in order to feed themselves. Meanwhile, humans are unaware of their condition and believe to be living in 1999, which is actually a digital projection programmed by robots and introduced in the human brain through wires. I believe this is a metaphor of the afore-mentioned 'rat trap' and therefore a critical view towards our reality.

However, as the plot progresses, it becomes evident that his mental problems come from the abandonment and the abuse he suffered from early childhood. He starts out as an employee in an entertainment sort of company where he acts as a clown in several different situations. After a brutal beating, he starts developing further character issues and the funding for the therapy sessions he attends gets shut down. Some co-workers kick him out of the company by framing him with illegal gun possession. Right after that, he gets into trouble by killing some men in the subway that were trying to force a girl. This event becomes popular among society and some people start wearing clown-faced masks to protest against criminals. He also murders one of his co-workers and starts painting his face as a crazy clown character whose name is the Joker.

The plot centers on Rose's and Jack's love story aboard the Titanic. Both Jack and Rose fell in love at first sight; however, their story was not meant to exist: Rose was about to get married to a rich man, Carl, who would pay for all of her father's debts.  <br/>  <br/> It was several days after the departure of the ship when they first met. One night, Rose was having dinner, and decided to leave the room and run towards the poop of the ship. She was tired of having good manners and behaving like a 'good girl'. She wanted to be herself, but the world wouldn't let her. This is the reason why she thought of jumping from the ship into the ocean and put an end to her suffering. However, Jack - who was in the exact same place  - noticed what the girl was planning to do, and ran towards her in order to stop her from jumping. From that day onwards, Jack and Rose saw each other several times, until Rose's mother found out she was falling in love with Jack. <br/>  <br/> Rose's conversation with her mother brought her back to reality. She was about to get married, so she couldn't let her love story with Jack go any further. However, as Rose was sick of acting and pretending she was in love with Carl, she decided to go back with Jack. They kissed and made love, and promised that they would run away after the ship arrived in New York.  <br/>  <br/> However, neither the Titanic nor Jack made it to America: the ship sank after hitting an iceberg, and Jack didn't survive. However, Rose survived and was rescued. She arrived in New York several days later, and after that, she began a new life. She married another man and had children. However, her heart never stopped loving Jack.

However, the name of the film has more to do with the main plot of the movie, since Idgie and Ruth, who are the protagonists, open a cafe whose main menu item is called like the title. As I've already mentioned, these two women are the focal point of the story, as they share a similar tragic background although they are completely different. While Ruth becomes a mother and gets married to an abusive man, Idgie refuses to settle and finds her own future without fitting standard gender roles. Although the storyline looks quite simple, the fact that it is narrated by an elderly lady called Ninny makes it more interesting as it creates a comparison between Idgie and Ruth's story and the current, more modern situation of Evelyn Couch, a mature wife who is really unhappy and tries to find her own self-confidence. Furthermore, the plot also involves the murder of Ruth's husband and the tragic death of Idgie's brother. In this sense. the film becomes the perfect field for a psicoanalitic study as well as a base for discussing gender roles, heteronormativity and even, racism. In general, I think this is a great movie since everytime you watch it, it gets better and you find out more about the underlying connections and metaphors that it entails.

The protagonist is a very powerful woman in America whose company has just gone bankrupt. Moreover, her boyfriend is not at all interested in the commitment of living together after 5 years of relationship. She decides to break up with him, but she has a mental breakdown and starts drinking. While being drunk, she enters an Inn contest for winning an Inn in New Zealand, which she wins. She decides to fly from America to New Zealand and fulfill her dream of building a sustainably maintained house. When she arrives she finds out that the Inn she's won, has actually been abandoned for decades. Nevertheless, she's committed to making it work. In this tiny town she meets a guy (obviously), who's actually really handsome and knows how to reform houses and even has a business for it. At first she hates him because she thinks he pitties her, but little by little she starts to understand that in this town, everyone helps each other not because of pity but because they care for each other and are nice like that. So eventually they fall in love, reform the house and travel together throughout New Zealand. The ex-boyfriend actually tries to win her back but it's too late. Finally, even though in the beginning her plan was to reform the Inn and go back to her life in San Francisco, she falls in love with her life in New Zealand and decides to stay in the house of her dreams with the man of her dreams.

The whole movie is about psychological issues but the audience doesn't know that until the very end. The protagonist is Jack, an eighteen-year-old guy. He, together with his mother and his siblings, moves to a house in the countryside. However, the mother dies soon and the four siblings stay in the house. From the very beginning the situation is weird, because Jack is obsessed with hiding all the mirrors and there is some secrecy regarding the father. Then, we discover that he was a murderer and went to prison, but he managed to escape. After the mother's death, the father showed up and apparently, the siblings locked him in the attic. But later on, the audience discovers this is not true. It was all product of Jack's imagination. The truth is that, when the father arrived, he killed his children in the attic. All of them except from Jack, who locked his father in the attic without food or drinks. However, the father did not die. After this, Jack went mad. He thought his brother and sister were still alive. He talked to them, he saw them, he played with them, etc. The characters of his siblings were actually ghosts produced by Jack's imagination. That is why he removed all the mirrors, because they demonstrated that his siblings were not real. One important thing is that the audience discovers the truth thanks to Jack's girlfriend, Allie. She gets his diary, reads it and finds out the truth. In that momento, she goes to the house looking for Jack but the father had escaped from the attic and tries to kill her. Jack recovers some common sense and finally kills his father to save her. At the end, Allie decides to stay with Jack. She becomes his wife and devotes her life to help him deal with his mental issues.

Even though I am not a big fan of horror movies, given that they are bad by nature, I had a grand time watching this film. It all started when I was going home after finishing my university lectures when some friends suggested that we could meet at somebody's house and have a movie night. After quite a long time deciding what to watch, we compromised and gave ""Annabelle"" a shot. The actual plot of the movie is nothing new: a happy family is tormented by a evil spirit. However, it is worth mentioning that the way it was executed was nothing less than brilliant. Instead of relying on jump-scares, the movie slowly builds up the tension from the very start. In fact, some friends were even closing their eyes at some points of the movie. Nonetheless, on a personal note, I must say that the movie should have been classified as a thriller more than a horror film since I did not find it really scary at all. I guess that even when movies are not that original or scary, the most important part of is the experience of watching it with a group of friends."

This film is starred by Joaquin Phoenix, and it is one of the biggest blockbusters of this year. It provides a possible origin for the character appearing in Batman's saga. But this film goes way beyond focusing on Batman's movies, since it follows the life of Arthur Fleck, a man who suffers mental illness and tries to do stand-up comedy but fails in his attempt. I believe that this film is so important because it treats the issue of mental illness, and it gives visibility to this issue. During the film, the character complains about the fact that society tends to expect people suffering mental illnesses to behave as if they do not have it, and I agree with this quote.  <br/> Besides, when I saw this film, it reminded me of another film called 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', which also deals with mental disorders.

He is transformed into a horrible beast and he is given an enchanted rose. The witch tells him that in order to break the spell he will need someone to love him with his new appearance. <br/> Belle is just a girl from a small village who just wants to live adventures and travel around the world. When his father dissapears, she does not doubt an instant and runs away from home to find him.  <br/> She gets to the enchanted castle and becomes the beast's prisoner in exchange of her father's freedom.  <br/> At the begining, Belle is horrified by the beast's aspect, but then she begins to see something else inside him. After some difficulties related mainly to Belle's suitor, Gaston, the Beast finally earns Belle's love and the curse breaks turning the Beast into the prince he was before. They finally get married and begin a life together in the castle.

The oldest son starts working as an english teacher for a high-class family and tricks the family into also hiring her sister, telling them she's just the friend of a friend who studied in the United States and has profound knowledge about children psychology and art. They also find the way to get rid of the rich family's driver and house assistant so their parents, camouflaged as strangers, can also work there. Everything seems to be going well but one night, the previous house assistant appears in the house and chaos ensues.

It tells the story about how the relationship between Aurora and Maleficient herself has developed. Maleficient goes through different stages and feelings; still, she does not trust on humans, as a fairy (who had her wings cut off when she was little by them) she does not believe people could change. However, Aurora does trust on them and wants to marry a prince, decision Maleficient does not understand. Anyhow, Maleficient accepts the King's invitation to visit the village and the castle as everything he wants is a peaceful alliance between the Kingdom and the Woods. But, as expected, everything turned out pretty bad for Maleficient and all forest dwellers."

The problem is that in this second part, her goddaughter is a human and wants to get married with the prince of the reign. Before the celebration, both Maleficent and her goddaughter are invited to the castle to have dinner. Once they are there the protagonist gets really furious remembering all the attacks she and her creatures have received in the past. In addition to this, the queen is constantly attacking her.

After some discussion we finally decided to watch Annabelle despite the fact that I am not keen on horror movies since I easily get scared and they always try to take advantage of that.  <br/> Regarding the plot, the only thing worth mentioning is that I wouldn't consider a creepy doll a good present, neither would I marry someone who is obsessed with collecting them. Moreover, this type of storyline is excessively overused and somewhat boring at this point. They have really dull, plane characters that do not ease the watching of the film for the spectator who is just hoping the doll would do anything other than stand there and exist. <br/> Irony aside, I consider this production to be just another addition to the genre, not bringing a lot to the table in regards of the content and performance of the action. For the purpose of pure entertainment it could be good enough, but it is definitely not worth paying the money.

It’s about a guy who discovers he can time travel, and he uses his powers to conquer the love of his life. Sometimes he’s a little bit silly and doesn’t foresee the consequences to some of his travels, but overall it gets the viewer really involved with him and his life. I would also like to mention that this movie is not only about love, but is also about family, friendship and living your life the best way possible.

As they start it up, one by one are sucked inside the game, appearing in the middle of the jungle with the physical appearance and abilities of the avatar they had previously chosen. Their adventure then begins, challenging not only their integrity but their trust in each other, and even in themselves. They will have to flee from some situations, such as escaping from the hands of a gold-digger who'll do anything to recover a gem the group is to return to its original place in order to end with the curse that has sank the jungle in an obscure mood. Eventually, with the help of a fifth player, who has been years trapped in the game, they'll accomplish their mission, and go back home, as if not a single minute has gone away. The four of them, now with a bond that breaks through classes, discover that the older kid they found in the game, is now an adult with a family of its own.

Film	written_online	15	Outside classroom	Spellchecker	Last week I watched a film called “Everything is illuminated”. I actually really liked this movie and I found it really inspiring because it was so creative that it made me want to create my own stories. The main character was a young American jew called Jonathan whose grandparents came to America from Ukraine because of World War II. The young man goes to Ukraine to try to find the woman who helped his now deceased grandfather escape from the nazis. There he meets an old man and his grandson called Alex who are the owners and only employees of a company that helps people find their ancestors. Alex becomes the other main character because of his big personality and the continuous cultural shocks between him and Jonathan give the movie a humorous touch. The big reveal is that the Ukrainian old man, Alex’s grandfather, is in fact also a jew and he was connected with the woman that helped Jonathan’s grandfather escape the nazis because her sister helped him as well. The movie ends with the old man’s suicide and his family giving him a jewish funeral in homage of all those years of hiding.  <br/> I think this is now one of my favourite films because it talks about something political and let’s you know about horrible things that actually happened but the director also knew how to give the story a humorous touch with surrealist moments and the help of the previously commented cultural shocks. I think this film is worth watching.

In this retelling of the classic Disney movie, we encounter the character of Maleficent again but from her side of the story. The king cuts her wings at the beginning of the story in order to become king and even though he and Maleficent are supposedly in love. Maleficent tries to take revenge by cursing the king's daughter and for the next 16 years the king becomes paranoid of a possible attack from Maleficent. Maleficent gets to know Aurora (the princess) in these 16 years and a bond is formed between both women. After the cursed takes effect it is Maleficent's kiss, one of true love, what in the end awakes Aurora from the curse. In the end, Maleficent recovers her wings and the king dies as an indirect effect of his own paranoia and bitterness.

Film	written_online	12	Inside classroom	Spellchecker	One of my favorite films is called Un cuento chino. It tells the story of an Argentinian middle-aged men who leads a very isolated life working in an appliance store. He basically rejects human contact due to trauma. If I remember correctly, his mother died when he was very young. In his teens he had a huge quarrel with his father and, right after that, he decides to enlist himself in the army to participate as a soldier in the War of Las Malvinas. His father was so disappointed in him, since he himself had feed from Italy to escape from war. While the protagonist is abroad, his father dies, so he never had a chance to reconcile with his father. After many years spent in isolation, a Chinese immigrant appears on the scene. He's lost and vulnerable, so the protagonist is forced to get out of his shell to help this man. It's a very sweet comedy. I do recommend it.
