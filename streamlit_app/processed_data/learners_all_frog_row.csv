They get out in the forest and are yelling for the frog. While the boy climbes on a tree for searching the frog there, the dog hits the house of bees what makes them angry. They are searching everywhere, on rocks, under rocks. Suddenly, while the boy is still on the rock, he gets hit by a deer and falls down a small cliff. The dog also falls and both of them are landing in a river. A broken tree that comes by is their help in danger because they catch it and make it out of the river.

The boy, with the frog in his hand, and the dog are leaving, waving goodbye to the rest of the frog family.

Timmy and his dog swam over to the shore and climbed over a fallen tree to get out of the water. But what was that? Behind this tree there was a family of frogs and Timmy recognised his frog.

In the morning,Tom and Jimmy wake up and see, that the frog is gone. Immediatly, they start looking for him. ""Froooog!"", shouts Tom, because they had not come up with a name yet. Jimmy is houling as well. The boy climbs up on a tree, the dog searches the ground, but they see no sign of the frog. <br/>  Tom then climbs a rock,leaning on a tree, not knowing that the tree is in deed a deer. The deer promptly throughs Tom and Jimmy of a little cliff, where they land in a little lake with a loud splash. While climbing out, they see the frog, who is obviously a male, since he is sitting there with what appears to be a lady-frog and many baby frogs. Since Tom and Jimmy know, that the frog now has dad-duties, they can impossibly take him with them. They then decide to take one of the frog children,whanting to show him or her - it looks like a him- a life outside the woods. Since dad-frog already realised that Tom and Jimmy are two lovable, caring ones, he approves of this idea. He is probably going to visit them soon, or maybe they will come back, who knows?  <br/>  The boy and the dog wave at the frog family, taking Billy, their own newest family member, with them."

Every night the boy and the dog were watching the frog until they fell asleep, but one night, when both of them were asleep, the frog managed to escape. When the boy and his dog woke up and noticed that the frog was gone they were desperate and decided to go out into the forest and look for him. After hours of searching all over the forest they still couldn't find the frog. They stepped on rocks, climbed on trees and even got to know other animals living in the forest. One of those animals was a deer. When the boy climbed on the deer's back looking for the frog it pushed him and his dog of an edge. The puddle of mud they fell in was right next to a fallen tree where they coincidentally found the frog and his whole family. The boy knew he couldn't take all of them and especially not the father, so he decided to take one of the smaller ones to take home with him and raise it.

They both were running and shouting here and there in the dense woodland, eben the dog was looking up to each single tree. Even the boy climbed up a big stone to watch better all around. Unfortunately behind the stone there was the cave of a big white deer who felt disturbed by all the noise of the shouting boy and his dog. The white deer jumped out of the bushes to the boy and kicked him into a lake next to the stone together with his dog. They both fell deep into the water - ouch - nevertheless after a while they succeeded in climbing out of the lake on to a branch of rodden wood, and there, at the border of the lake, finaly they found Marvin. How surprised they were to see that Marvin wasn't no longer alone. He was sitting there on another big branch together with his new friend, Michel, a second frog.

One day a young boy called leo went outside for a walk with his dog. they went through the woods to get some air as suddenly a hurt little frog caught their sight. The frog seemed to be hurt so right away the boy decided to take the poor animal home with him. After they have walked all the way back home and put the frog in a big glass jar the boy and his dog wanted the frog to recover from all the stress he had. It was a lon exhausting day so the boy and dog went to bed to catch some sleep. Waking up the next morning the boy worringly could see that the hurt frog has disappeared. He grabbed his dog and ran ourside to look everywhere for the little animal. Behind the trees in all the bushes and little holes but they couldn't find the frog anywere. The boy decided to climb on a big rock to have a better overview. Suddenly he fell over and landed in the bushes. What he didnt know was that there was a massive deer in there and he basicly fell on the deer's head. Reacting shocked and wanting to protect itself the deer ran after the boy and dog and pushed them down a small cliff. Luckily they landed in a lake so they didnt get hurt at all. The boy and dog carred themselves out of the water and because they were so exhausted of searching for their little frog friend they leaned over an old fallen down tree.What they were able to see behind this tree was unbelievable.There he was their little frog, looking at them and seeming to be alright again. He wasn't even alone, no, he was with his frog girlfriend and children. The boy and dog were so happythey have found him and were even more pleased about the fact that the fog has a lovely family that cares for him. After spending a little time together the boy and dog decided to go home as they knew their new friend was save. They said goodbye and decided to meet up soon again.

After some days, while Benny was asleep the frog climbed out of the glass and left the house. Neither Benny nor Bunker were able to understand why the frog had left when they realized he had gone. Therefore, Benny and Bunker decided to look for the frog. They went into a nearby forest and shouted in the woods. Benny climbed a tree and a rock. Suddenly the rock turned out to be an elk. The elk rose so that Benny and Bunker were tossed down a cliff. They fell into a pond. After getting out of the water they sat down on a trunk. Coincidentally looking around, Benny saw the frog. Yet the frog was not alone. There were eight frogs sitting in a circle. Now Benny understood. He could not be the frog's friend or family as the frog already had one. So Benny and Bunker decided to leave the frogs alone and waved to say goodbye. They returned home and thought about their little adevnture.

He was so proud and happy to have a new animal friend besides his doggy. ,The boy was sleeping in his bed and didn't notice that the frog was escaping from his little glass prison.As soon as he woke up , he looked at the jar to check up on his little friend but to his surprise the jar was empty. Where was his froggy? Together with his dog he tried to figure out where he could have gone but all this thinking and not doing anything about it killed the boy. So he set off on the quest to find the little frog with his dog , because two eyes and a dog nose should be able to find the wild frog. They look all over the forest where he found the frog when he first caught it. He climbed trees and stones and yelled for his lost friend at the top of his lungs.While he was standing on a particularly big stone, he leaned over to hold onto what appeared to be branches from a tree but those branch suddenly began to move and picked him up. It was a deer with his giant antlers who carried him to a cliff and threw him off the edge. The poor boy fell into a river where he struggled not to drown. Luckily, he managed to pull him self onto a log that was close. He sat on the log for a while to rest when he spotted a frog family and imagine that -one of the bunch was his little lost froggy friend! The boy,his doggy and the frog are happy to be reunited and lived happily ever after.One day there was a little boy sitting on the bedroom floor with his dog. It was later in the evening and dark outside. The two of them were whatching a frog sitting in a glass between them. After a while the boy went to bed and his dog lay down on his legs. When they were sleeping suddenly the frog klimbed out of the glass and jumped through the window. When the boy and his dog woke up in the morning they discovered the empty glass and were very surpised and shocked. The boy dressed himself and ran out of the house always followed by his dog. They started to search for the frog. They went into the forest and screamed and looked erverywhere for the frog. Then the boy climbed onto a rock to see a little more. What he didn't notice was a male (...) standing just behind the rock. When the boy tried to hold himself at the horn of the (..) it caught him right in the shirt and threw him in the pond next to them. The dog fell with him and they both swam to a fallen tree just at the boarder of the pond. When they climbed over the tree they suddenly discovered their frog with it's whole family sitting together. They were so happy and suprised about this beautiful image, that they let the frog outside with it's family wishing him all the best. Then they left to search for a new adventure.

In the evening he was so tired of such an interesting and exciting day that he fell asleep early, without checking if the glass was closed properly. At night the frog escaped the glass and when James and his dog woke up the next morning, the frog had dissapeared. James took his best best friend with the cold and wet nose and ran into the forest searching for the frog. They searched everywhere they could think of. Since they could not find the frog, James decided to hike on a big stone where he saw an elk and fell on it. The elk was very mad and pushed him down a little hill. James and his dog fell into a small lake and as they wanted to get out of the water with the help of a fallen tree, he suddenly saw the frog. He was very happy about this and wanted to take it home with him again but then he realized that the frog was surrounded by its family and seemed very happy. James made up his mind and cleared his thoughts. He could not take him away from his beloved ones again. Therefore, he decided to leave the frog with its family and left the forest with his dog. In the end, the frog lived happy with its family and James learned that it is sometimes better to leave his own wants behind to help others and make others happy.

In fact, they seem to be really interested in the its behaviour.  <br/>  When the little boy goes to sleep at night, the little frog decides to leave. Since the glass has been left open, he can easily escape.  <br/>  The next morning, the boy wakes up and is shocked: The little frog is gone! Consequently, he decides to look for him and goes into the woods. He calls his frog's name, but does not get any reply. His dog and him try to find their friend in various places: they even have a look into a tree. During their time in the forest, the boy tries to look everywhere and even gets into an interesting situation with a deer, who throws him into water. Now it becomes clear that the little boy really has to go through a lot to find his friend. In the end, he looks behind a tree and finds the frog he has been looking for. His little friend is surrounded by other frogs, possibily his family. Lastly, the young boy leaves with the dog and waves the frogs goodbye. Obviously, he has agreed to let him live with his family and goes home without him.

This child also had another close friend, a small frog, which he put into a glass bottle home. Every day they played together and spent a lot of time together, making them true friends. Until someday the little frog slipped out of his bottle and ran away from home. When the boy realized the frog's disappearance, he was shocked and went outside with his dog to look for him. He shouted his frog's name and looked into treeholes, while the dog destroyed a home of bees. The search seemed hopeless until the boy climbed up a rock to get a better view. Then something pushed him off the cliff and while he was falling, he saw that a deer was responsible for it. The child fell into a swamp, where his dog already waited and pulled him to land. Finally, the boy gathered himself, looked around him and saw he was in the middle of a frog swamp. His own frog friend was one of them. The boy grasped his friend happily and waved goodbye to the other frogs. In the end, the child went home with both his friends and lived a normal life again.

When little Timmy had to go to bed, he forgot to put the lid on the glass, the frog had been in so he had the chance to escape while Timmy and Jasper were sleeping. In the morning they found the green little hopper missing. Even before breakfast, Timmy and Jasper went into the forest searching for the frog. ""Frog, where are you? Froggy, Fro-hog, Mr. Frog,"" Timmy shouted towards the trees. Jasper went looking at the smaller places, even met some bees who were nice enough not to sting him, and Timmy went for the bigger hiding places, climbed trees and big rocks. Because the rock was covered in moss, Timmy grabbed a treebranch to hold on to. But, oh no! That wasn't a treebranch, it was a deer standing behind the rock. Timmy fell over onto its head and grabbed his crown harder. The deer didn't like that very much and started running and jumping to get little Timmy off his head. He stopped right before a small cliff so harshely, that Timmy couldn't hold on much longer and fell over into a little pond below. Luckily Jasper found him sitting in the cold, muddy water and helped him to get out. But, what was that? Timmy had heard a loud, familiar sound. Behind a dead treestem he looked for the noisemaker. It was his frog and - wow - his little frogfamily. ""Good morning, Mr. Frog, Mrs Frog and you little froggy baby's."", Timmy whispered not to scare them. One of the baby frogs really wasn't scared at all. He hopped towards Timmy and said ""Ribbit!"" Jasper seemed surprised but a second after he licked the small frog all over its back. Timmy heard a grumpling sound from somewhere down and felt his tummy and suddenly also his hunger. As he stood up, he saw the little frog jumping towards him and caught him in his hand. It seemed, he wanted to come with them. So Timmy said goodbye to Mr. and Mrs. Frog, walked trought the pond and was lookig forward to the breakfast. Maybe his mother had some flies left in the kitchen for his new little green friend."

One night Timmy and his two pets - a puppy named Bo and a green frog named Tammy - were sitting on the floor of his bedroom and listening to the dark night and the whisper of the wind. As usual Tammy was captured in a glass jar, so the frog would not run away (which she loved to do when noone was looking). Later that night Timmy went to bed, and even Bo managed to get some sleep, even though thunder and wind of the night were knocking at the bedroom's window. Suddenly Tammy the frog silently climed out of her glass jar and escaped through the half open window into the darkness. The next morning Timmy and Bo woke up in utter shock. They realized the second that they opened their eyes that something was different: Tammy had escaped and left them. The frog was gone and off to her very own adventure. Timmy and Bo started looking for the frog in the nearby forrest. They yelled her Name ""Tammy, Tammy"" over and over again, but noone answered. When they got deeper into the dark woods, there still was no sight of the green, little frog. Finally, Timmy climed a big rock to get a better view of his surroundings. Just as he started to yell out ""Tammy"" again, a deer suprised him. The gigantic animal lifted poor little Timmy up and carried the boy a few steps away. Sad little Bo had to watch the deer dropping his friend in the cold waters of the nearby river. Bo also fell into the water in a desperate attempt to save Timmy. The boy fell head down first into the water - it was quite a rough landing. However: Luckily Timmy and Bo both survived and found themselves laying on a floating tree stem. Both of them laughted again and were very happy to find themselves alive. But not only this. When the tree stem floated a little bit further, Timmy and Bo caught sight of frog Tammy. They could not believe their eyes when they saw the Tammy was now a wife of another green frog and had a couple of children to her side as well. Timmy was incredibly happy to find his friend alive and so happy with her very own family. He decided to leave Tammy in the forrest, where she could live happily ever after with her own frog-family. And so did Timmy and his little dog, when they ultimately returned home to his house by the forrest."

After a while, Tim and his dog went to bed and imediately fell asleep. The frog knew that he was able to get free again and jumped out of the jar. Whenever the little boy woke up, he realized that the frog was gone. He felt bad for the frog and, together with his dog, he went to the woods to look after the frog. They called him, but of course, the frog did not answer the two. Tim had an idea and started to search in every little hole he could find: while he climbed onto an old tree to see if the frog was hiding up there, the dog started to see if the frog hid in an bee's home, but the frog could not be found anywhere. From the tree, Tim saw a big stone in the woods, on that he climbed to have a better overview over the area. While he sat on it and screamed for the frog , a deer appeared and took Tim on his head. He walked a few metres and threw him and his dog into a pond. Tim was really mad at the deer and in addition to that he was all wet, but did not give up searching. Suddenly, the two heard a sound behind an old branch of wood and got interested. They looked behind it and found the frog and his family sitting together happily. Tim had no idea that the only thing the frog wanted, was to be with his family and did not realize that the frog might be unhappy being alone in a jar. Tim took one of the frogs into his hands and thought about the pleasure he had watching the frog in his jar the day before. Finally, Tim and his dog were happy about their finding and took the frog home again.

The two got out of the lake and after climbing over a tree stem, lying on the ground, they discovered a little frog familiy. Their befriended frog was one of them. Happy that they have found the frog again, they took him back home. The End.

He imagined the adventures he would have with the dog and was happy to have him as a pet. At night, when the boy and the dog were asleep, the little frog decided to escape his glass home and go on a journey. When the boy woke up in the morning, he was shocked not finding his frog in the glass. He missed him and was sad because of all the adventures that he planned to have with the frog and that now would never happen, since the frog was not there anymore. The boy decided to go outside and look for his frog with the dog. They went to the fields and forests and screamed the little frogs name as loud as their bodies were able to. But they couldn't find the frog. Neither in the fields, nor in the forests. Not even inside of any tree the little boy climed into. The frustrated little boy saw a rock that was not to big for him to climb it and just big enough to be able to look over the bushes when standing on it. Unluckily a deer was hiding behind the rock, wanting to spend some time alone. As the dear was not amused for a shouting little boy to disturb his peace, it took the little boy on his head and pushed him and his little dog into the nearby river. The two fell into the river and escaped soaking wet to the next piece of wood that was lying on the riverside. When they managed to get on the other side of the piece of wood to save themselves, they found the little frog they were searching for sitting on the ground. The frog was visiting his family, which also sat on the ground, looking up to the boy and the dog. The frog decided to come back home with the boy and the dog, thinking that he had spend enough holiday time and being exhausted from the long walk around the forest. The boy, the dog and the frog friendly waved goodbye, as they were heading back home.

There was nothing much left, so the boy, by the name of Tommy, had to be very creative and had to constantly come up with new ideas to keep himself busy and make his life as exciting as possible. His parents worked a lot, so his best companion was a dog, by the name of Pilot. Tommy and Pilot did everything together and eventhough Pilot wasn't able to articulate his feelings verbally, Tommy knew what he was thinking at all times.  <br/>  One morning they woke up to examine what they had caught the day before: a frog. Both studied this little creature in awe, for frogs were not easy to find these days. Yet, the frog managed to escape out of the Jar Tommy had put him in. He couldn't believe his eyes when he realised that once again it was only him and Pilot left alone. But what if something happened to him, tommy thought, and decided to go and look for him. They searched the entire house, the garden, under the bed...nothing. It didn't make sense to Tommy. Why would his new friend leave him and Pilot, when he has a better life here? They went out to the forest and started to search in bushes, behind and inside trees, yet they still couldn't find him. Altough Tommy wasn't the tallest boy, he had the courage to climb up big rocks and trees. That must be friendship, Pilot thaught, and continued to look for his new friend. <br/>  As Tommy was standing on the rock, a malicious animal came from behind and pushed him aggressively. It turned out to be a deer. Tommy had never seen these kinds of animals before. Since everything was not as it had been in the country, formerly known as the USA, these animals were hardly ever seen in the forest. Tommy and Pilot were scarred and didn't quite know what to do. They both managed to run away and hide for a while. While they were hiding, Tommy took the chance to examine the environment around him. Suddenly he jumped up and started to wave his hands in excitement. ""We found him, Pilot! Look! We found him!"" On the other side was the frog with his whole family waiting for Tommy and Pilot. Tommy and Pilot felt relieved. All those struggles to find their new best friends weren't for nothing.  <br/>  Tommy, Pilot and the Frog(-family) became close friends. Everyday they would visit each other and go on adventures. Altough Tommy's own family was hardly ever at home, he found a new family."

Henry wanted to find Luke so desperately that he climbed a very dangerous-looking rock to have a better view over the forest.  <br/>  Suddenly a stag came out of the bushes and pushed Henry and Bob into the river. Fortunately, there was a dead tree in the river so that they did not drown but could rescue themselves. <br/>   Sitting on the tree, they suddenly noticed a little frog family watching them.

So the next morning, when they woke up, they were devastated. They went outside to look for the frog. They looked in the backyard, in the streets and in the forest. ""Frog!"", they yelled with every step they took. Charlie climed up every tree and rock and Speedy was looking under bushes and rocks. ""Frog!"", they yelled. Then something happened. While Charlie was standing on a big rock, trying to overlook the whole area, a deer came up behind him and pushed him down the rock. Charlie and Speedy fell into a lake. ""Ew! What a mess!"", Charlie said. They got out of the lake in their wet clothes and fur. But just when they sat down on an old tree to rest for a minute, they saw the frog. And they did not just see the frog that they kept in a glass at home. In fact, they saw a whole frog family. That was when Charlie knew that his frog escaped to see his family and that he was in a better place now. So Charlie and Speedy said goodbye to the frog family and left to go back home. They looked behind to wave and they saw the whole frog family sitting on the tree watching them leave."

One day Jackson and Chester went for a walk in the woods and they found a frog that seemed to be a little lonely. Jackson immediately fell in love with this little frog and decided to take him home. He named him Froggy. When Jackson came home he went straight into the kitchen , took a huge glas out of the cupboard and decided that this should be the place for Froggy to feel at home. Back in his room Jackson starred with such admiration at Froggy as if he had found a new best friend. And even his dog Chester got along with Froggy. But late at night when Jackson and Chester were asleep, Froggy climbed out of his new home and jumped right out of the window. The next morning when Jackson and Chester woke up they were really shocked to find no Froggy in their room. Jackson was really sad and missed Froggy so badly that he went out to search for Froggy in the woods. Of course, Chester was beside him, like always. When they finally arrived in the woods they called his name out loud. ""Froggy , Froggy !!! Where are you?"" . And even Chester helped Jackson to look for him. But Froggy was nowhere to find. When Jackson decided to climb onto a huge rock to get a better overview he must have overseen the deer that was behind it. He accidently held on to the deer, because he thought that it was a tree. That is when the deer got nervous and moved, which caused Jackson , and Chester who was behind him , to fall right over it and directly into the sea . Luckily they both know how to swim so they didn't panic. When they came out of the water they held on to a big fallen tree and felt safe rightaway. After they stood up and realised what just had happend and how unlucky they were they discovered Froggy . He sat behind the tree with his family. Froggy-wife and Froggy-children. This was the moment when Jackson realised what he had done and that he never thought about the fact that Froggy might have a family when he took him home. So he decided to go home with Chester and leave Froggy be alone with his family. He waved Froggy and his family goodbye and went for a walk with his old buddy Chester.Although he really misses Froggy he knew that it was for the best. And if they didn't die, they still all live happily ever after."

Otis was kept in a jar on the floor. On this certain day the little boy forgot to close the jar properly and Otis escaped the jar and then the whole house. When the little boy noticed that his green friend was gone he was shocked and decided to search for him in the park near his house. Butter and the little boy shouted after Otis and searched everywhere. In beeholes, on trees on stones. However, Otis was nowhere to be found. One of the stoneswhich the little boy climbed upon was so high that he had to grab the stitches of a near tree. At least that was he had thought. In fact, the stitches were part of a forest animal that pushed Butter and him into the lake. Luckily both of them were good swimmers and and it did not take them long to rescue themselves. They were absolutely suprised when they found Otis on the other side of the lake. By his side there was another frog and a bunch of tiny frog babies. So that was where Otis had run to! Empathetic as he was, the little boy congratulated Otis, and Butter and him left with a heartwarming farewell.

As Timmy and Spencer climbed onto a rock, a deer suddenly appeared and shoved them into a little pond. Luckily they were able to swim and got out of the water.

As soon as the sun rose, the dog and the boy woke up to see that their frog had run away the night before. They started looking for it everywhere and especially in the forest. The boy climbed up trees whereas the dog helped him search on the ground. They even climbed up big stones and hills and called for the frog but the only animal they found is a deer. The deer pushed the boy and his dog into a small lake but that did not stop the two of them from searching for their frog. Once again they climbed over things crossing their way until they finally found the frog with his family. They took their little frog home and waved his family goodbye.

The little boy was sad and decided to search for his green friend together with his dog. They called him out in the forest where they had found him, but the frog did not answer. The little boy and his dog searched the trees and bee hives and yet there was no sign of their friend. Eager to friend his friend the boy climbed up a rock and hold on to a tree branch, so he could shout out loudly one more time. However the ""tree branches"" turned out to be the horns of a deer that was scared by the boy's sudden grip. So he violently shook him off causing the boy and his dog to fall over the edge into a small pound. Luckily the pound wasn't very deep so they managed to get a hold onto a tree trunk close to them. When the boy had recovered and climbed over the tree trunk together with his dog he was more than surprised to find his frog, he had been searching for the entire day. What was even more surprising, was the fact that the frog was not alone but had afamiy inclduing his wife and many kids. Now that the boy knew why his newly found friend had escaped his home, he was able to let go. So he and his dog returned to their home and wished the frog and his family the very best."

They had been on many adventures together but this evening they are looking at one very interesting finding. They found a big frog and managed to catch him using a glass jar. They took a close look at him before going to sleep but the frog managed to escaoe. After waking up the boy is quite surprised to see the empy jar and so he went out with his dog to find his frog again. They went out into the forest where they found him last day and searched for him everywhere. The dog used his nose to look for traces the frog might have left and the boy tried climbing on trees and rocks while loudly shouting out to the frog. However, a stag felt disturbed by all this noise so he grabbed the boy while he was standing on top of a rock and tossed him into the nearby waters using his big antlers. The boy and his dog managed to get out of the water by using a drifting log and swimming back to the land on it. Luckily for them, right there where they got the ground back on their feet they found the frog, happily standing next to his wife and his many children. The frog was very impressed by the many troubles they took onto themselves just to find him once again and even though he did not like being in captivity he was now convinced that also his children can learn a lot from the boy and his braveness so he offered one of his children to him. Maybe one day little frog jr. will return back to his father and be just as adventerous and brave as our boy and his dog following every step he makes

Together with his little dog, he looked for the frog in the woods. Although they called him all the time and although they looked for him in every corner of the forest, they did not find him. Suddenly,a deer appeared behind the bushes and pushed the little boy and the dog so hard that they fell into a pond. Fortunately, there lay a big tree trunk next to the lake so that the little boy and his dog could climb out of the pond. They could not believe it, but next to the trunk they found the little frog together with his frog family. As the little boy knew that the frog would be happier with his family he took leave and went home.

They went into the woods, calling out for the frog, which was nowhere in sight. They looked everywhere for him, even high up in the trees. When Jimmy climed a huge rock to look behind a giant bush, the bush somehow became alive and moved. It appeared to be a deer, that hid behind it. It pushed both, Jimmy and his dog, down an embankment, right into a little lake. They got out of it, completely wet. Then, right behind a fallen tree, they finally found the frog. Surprisingly, the frog sat there in the middle of what seemed to be his little family. Little Jimmy did not want to part him from his family, but the frog insisted they should take one of his babies, so they will remember him. And so they left, little Jimmy, his dog and the baby-frog, as they waved good-bye.

They wanted their new friend back and were scared something might have happened to him. They even climbed trees and searched in every possible spot. When the boy climbed a rock, suddenly, a deer appeared and threw him into a pond next to the rock the boy had climbed. The dog landed next to the boy in the pond. Completely soaked they managed to climb out of it, holding on to a tree that had fallen down. When they took a breath on that tree stem they noticed something: There it was, the frog they had been searching for for the whole time. It was there with its wife and a few kids.

As that got boring pretty quickly, Tim and Struppi decided to call it a night and go to bed. What they did not expect was, that the frog had just waited for this to happened and regained his strength and climbed out of the jar. When Tim and Struppi saw the empty jar in the morning, they could not believe it and decided to go search for their friend in the forest, where they had foud the frog the day before. <br/>  They searched everywhere, Tim climbed every tree in the area to get a better view and Struppi got himself into trouble with a bee hive, when trying to find the frog around it. Tim also climbed rocks, which his mum had always told him not to, since they can be pretty slippery, but that was not the problem... He held onto what he thought was a branch of a bush, but suddenly this branch started moving and he got picked up by a deer that had rested behind the rock. It gave Tim a good push and he fell down a little cliff, accompanied by his true friend Struppi.  <br/>  Both landed in the little pond below and got a big fright. They draged themselves out of the water and on to a dead tree stem, where they let out many coughs and took a couple of deep breath, before they were able to climb on top of the stem and look around. They could not believe what they saw: it was the frog family they found the day before and one of the frogs jumped towards Tim and Struppi straight away. That must be their friend, they thought, and since both sides seemed equally happy to be reunited, the rest of the frog family did not mind their fellow leaving with his friends. <br/>  Tim carried the frog on his hand, since he did not bring he jar, and with his other hand he waved good bye to the rest of the frog family.

They even went to look for him on top of a rock and in bushes. In one of the bushes was a deer hidden and the deer heaved the boy up with his antlers and threw him into a small lake, which was more of a big puddle really.

Suddenly, a big reindeer appeared out of the blue, took Timmy on its horns and threw him and Pyp over a tiny cliff into a pond. They were all soaking wet, but no matter how much reason they had to be upset about this unexpected encounter, they turned out thankful. When they looked behind big fallen tree trunk, they finally found Higgins. <br/>  But this was not the end of the story: They realised that Higgins had a wife and many little children and felt horribly sorry for having taken him away from his loved ones the other day.

While he himself was very happy about his new pet - a friend for his dog Butcher, mayhaps -, the frog did not share this happiness and escaped in the middle of the night. When waking up, Timmy was shocked to find out that the frog was gone, so he decided to go and look for him outside. He and Butcher spent almost the whole day wandering in the forest, climbing up trees and rocks, shouting (and barking) all the way. But the frog was nowhere to be found. Instead Timmy stumbled over a deer with majestic horns when he climbed up a pretty stone. The deer, not happy with a little, stupid boy on his head, got angry and threw Timmy and Butcher into a lake. Both boy and dog were soaking wet when they came out of the water. Exhausted, Timmy lay down flat on his belly over a tree trunk - and, miracles happen, this is were he found the escaped prisoner. The frog, he now learned, had a family. Upon realizing what this meant, Timmy decided to leave the frog in the depths of the forest and made his way home. Fortunately, he did not get in trouble with the deer again.

Unsurprisingly, they were very worried about the little frog. As a result, they both started looking for the frog in the forest. They shouted his name at the top of their lungs and looked in every place they could think of. Doing so, the little boy climbed on a rock and held on to what appeared to be a stick of a tree, not paying attention to whom this stick really belonged - a deer. The deer picked the little boy up and then threw him and his dog down a cliff. However, this cliff was not very high and both landed unharmed in a lake. Being in the lake, they heard a noise which sounded very familiar - it reminded them of their pet frog. Following the direction of the noise, the little boy and the do looked behind a huge dead tree. To their suprise, they found their frog surrounded by a couple of other frogs. Realizing that their friend would be happier around his family, the little boy and the dog left the frog in the forest.

At some point they had encountered a frog and managed to capture him in a large jar. Now it was getting dark and Mark sat in his room, contemplating the frog with curiosity. Soon he became tired and went to sleep. However, when he woke up the next morning, the jar was empty. Left unguarded, the frog had managed to escape at night. Mark was sad that the frog had abandoned him, since he only wanted to become friends with him. So, in order to find his friend, Mark and the dog went back out into the fields and started calling out to the frog. They looked in the fields, and in the forest. Finally, and near desperation, Mark climbed onto a huge rock and once more shouted for the frog. He did not receive an answer, but suddenly a deer broke through the trees and pushed both Mark and the dog off a cliff. Screaming, they fell into a pond, wwhich they had overseen before. As both were good swimmers they managed to climb out of the water without difficulties. While they were catching their breath, Mark suddenly caught sight of the very frog they had been looking for all the way. And he wasn't alone: Mark realised that the frog he had captured so selflessly had, in fact, a family. When he realised this, Mark decided it was better to leave the frogs in the forest, where they belonged. He waved goodbye and, along with the dog, started the journey back home.

He loved animals, he loved watching them and playing with them and he loved to keep them all to himself. His oldest companion, a dog named Woof, followed him everywhere he could and helped his master to sniff out new animals. <br/>  One day the boy and his dog found a little frog, took him carelessly with them and forced the poor thing into a glass-jar to be oggled at. In the night, as the boy and his dog were sleeping, the poor frog made a desperate attempt to flee.

Together with his dog he began to search for desperately, not willing to grant the frog its freedom. He searched far and wide, when he couldn't find him close, he went to the edge of the forest, when he could not find him there, he made his way into the forest. He looked into treetrunks, getting more and more frustrated as he couldn't find the little frog. The dog too looked feverously for it, but couldn't find it either. The boy grew angry and went as far as to climb on a small boulder, hoping to get a better view. He shouted and raged so loud, that even his loyal companion Woof ducked closer to the ground. <br/>  But the boy made a mistake there. A young stag, having heard the raging child and knowing about his callous nature, attacked the boy and tried to attack him to make him leave the forest. The boy and his dog startled and fell into a small pond. As they made their way out of the water and climbed over a fallen treetrunk, they say the frog family desperatly hiding behind it. <br/>  Smiling to himself he reached for the little frog, took him into his hands and waved mockingly at the little frog's upset family, which would never see their son and brother again. <br/>  And so the selfish little boy would continue to steal wild animals from their family and home for his amusement, never truly knowing the pain he caused.

Thankfully, it was not al that deep of a pond so they swam to the shore and climbed up an old tree trunk to get out. When they climbed up the tree trunk, Imagine what they saw?

Their frog friend alongside what seems to be his family. Tim realises that he should not have taken the frog away in the first place, since he does not belong in the house of a human being and has his own home.

He was so proud and happy to have a new animal friend besides his doggy. ,The boy was sleeping in his bed and didn't notice that the frog was escaping from his little glass prison.As soon as he woke up , he looked at the jar to check up on his little friend but to his surprise the jar was empty. Where was his froggy? Together with his dog he tried to figure out where he could have gone but all this thinking and not doing anything about it killed the boy. So he set off on the quest to find the little frog with his dog , because two eyes and a dog nose should be able to find the wild frog. They look all over the forest where he found the frog when he first caught it. He climbed trees and stones and yelled for his lost friend at the top of his lungs.While he was standing on a particularly big stone, he leaned over to hold onto what appeared to be branches from a tree but those branch suddenly began to move and picked him up. It was a deer with his giant antlers who carried him to a cliff and threw him off the edge. The poor boy fell into a river where he struggled not to drown. Luckily, he managed to pull him self onto a log that was close.

The boy was very upset when he woke up and found the frog had gone, got dressed and went out to look for him always accompanied by his loyal dog. <br/>  Out into the woods they went, looking high and low, with the boy climbing a tree and then a large rock where he steadied himself by holding onto the branches of a tree, or so he thought. Instead he had grabbed hold of the antlers of a great stag that now impatiently tossed him over a ledge and into a pond. <br/>  The little boy however, did not give up on his search and finally found his frog hidden behind the trunk of a fallen tree. The frog was not on his own though, it was sitting with his entire family of little frogs and Mrs Frog. <br/>  In the end the little boy left the father frog with his family and took one of the little froglets home, waving a happy good-bye to the rest of the frog family.

As he loved animals, he put it into a  bottle and with his dog, they both returned home. When they arrived there, the boy was very exhausted after a long day, so he went to his bedroom directly. Before going to sleep, he looked at his frog and after that he rested. At night, the frog escaped from the bottle and got out of the boy's house. The next morning, when the boy got up, he couldn't see it, and this made him feel very worried. He got dressed and went to the countryside with his dog to find the frog. They looked for in every place at the forest: inside of a tree, next to the river, under a trunk... but they didn't find anything. The boy was very sad but he finally gave up and returned home, this time, without frog, but he still had the company of his lovely dog.

I was not going to give up that easy, so I continued with my search. I did not want to be at the forest at night, as the lack of lights scared me, so we had to hurry up. <br/> I climbed small trees, big trees; small rocks, big rocks; I shouted till I was almost voiceless, but I found nothing. Everything I was doing was in vain, and I started to feel tired and even frustrated.  <br/> However, Fortune always shows up in the most unpredictable moments; and, when I had lost the hope of finding my frog, I fell to lake and, right on the lake's shore, behind a big log, there was my frog! It seemed like it had found a group of frogs to be with, but I could not handle the fact of being separated of my frog, so I took it and carried it back home.  <br/> Now, I always close my window at night, I do not want it to run away anymore!

Unfortunately, the frog didn't feel as comfortable living there as the dog did, since it profoundly missed its family and its long routs throughout the swaps. One day, the frog decided to leave, and after getting its little luggage ready, it parted. The kid and the dog were worried sick and decided to go look for it. They now felt lonely without it, it was an important part of their lives. After hours and hours of non-stopping screams and legs ache, a doe pushed the kid down a small edge which lead to a swap. He then found the frog there. He wanted it back but... he didn't even think about looking for it there, its perfect habitat. So, the frog argued that it didn't feel loved or considered and that it had made its decision. Goodbye.

But what he didn't know it was that, during the night, the frog had escaped from the jar; so when the boy woke up and saw the empty jar in front of him, he decided to go search the  frog outside. He went to the forest with his dog, where he looked and search in th trees, he even got on a top of a big rock, but unfortunately there was a male deer  hiding in some bushes behind it, so the deer took the little boy on his snout and horns and then he dropped him into a pond that was nearby. The poor kid tried his best to get out of the water, and so did his dog. They used a trunk that was close to help them getting out and as soon he leaned over it, he found the frog, and not just the frog, all the frog's family was living in the pond. That's how he realised he had to leave the frog with its family, so he smiled and waved goodbye while heading back home with his dog.

When Pete and the doggy wake up, they discover that the froggy is gone. Sad and disappointed they go and look for it, first following a path which leads to a big wood, then in the wood where  the boy jumps up a tree to look in every hole but there is no answer, the doggy barks and  howls but there is no answer.  They call its name once and once again but the froggy just want to be free like the owl behind the tree and like the bees celebrating their hive and their honey  and enjoy the nature because it was born to be free in its pond.

They got up and dripped away the water.

When he got up, he found out that his frog was not where it used to be and started to wonder what could have happened.

They looked in the prairie, but it wasn't there, so they went into the forest tokeep looking. It wasn't in the trees, nor behind a rock. Instead, they found a deer who picked the boy by its antlers, and threw him over a small cliff! The boy and the dog fell into a pond, and were completely wet. They still hadn't found their friend, so they decided to keep looking. Finally, they decided to look for it behind a fallen tree trunk, and there it was! Their friend was there, but it was not alone! It was surrounded by a lot of other frogs - they were a family! In the end, the dog and the boy decided that it was best if they left their friend to take care of their new family.
